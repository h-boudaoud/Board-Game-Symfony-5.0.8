Everyone from 9 to 40 caught on quickly, so I ran through a couple of Alien powers and then assigned them randomly.I love watching emergent strategies around the table as people try different things and different alliances. This one is going to run and run.","user":{"username":"andybeta","id":"iBINPaJZ01"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FVKaz7JhBO"}}},{"id":"vnwxmn23In","date":"2020-03-09T23:06:09.903Z","rating":4,"title":"Immediate ...","description":"Immediate hit with our group of mostly eurogamers.

I find that it tends to end too quickly.  Racial special powers can sometimes only be used once before the end of the game.  Negotiating aspect can make this one run long for our group.  Still, sci-fi theme is enjoyable and replay value is limitless given the huge number of different races.","user":{"username":"permagoof","id":"EE9k3rx1UU"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FVKaz7JhBO"}}},{"id":"hsdt2TLjqu","date":"2020-02-28T01:35:35.102Z","rating":3,"title":"The epic s...","description":"The epic space game of infinite possibilities!","user":{"username":"BGillz81","id":"wxvBXzSKgJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FVKaz7JhBO"}}},{"id":"mvVIeIfJNX","date":"2020-02-26T18:05:16.006Z","rating":4,"title":"Every alie...","description":"Every alien is OP and meant to break the game.
