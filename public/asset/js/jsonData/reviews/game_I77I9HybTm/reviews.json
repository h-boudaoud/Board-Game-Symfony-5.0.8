Why do we love Avenue but can't make it through a game of Welcome To... without getting bored? In part it's because Welcome To... feels like it's all marketing (beyond just the theme of marketing a neighborhood) and no game. \"Look at how commercial our game looks! Check a box!\"\n\nOriginal comment:\nI dunno...I really want to like roll\/draw-and-write games but none have won me over yet. Welcome To... doesn't seem to do anything special beyond the presentation so it's not the one to do the trick.","user":{"username":"Blap The Smaker","id":"2nAlqZMPU7"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"I77I9HybTm"}}},{"id":"95hdZykqth","date":"2020-02-14T22:09:14.717Z","rating":2,"title":"Enjoyed my...","description":"Enjoyed my first play a lot but on the second one I started having concerns about replayability. A lot of times we ended up picking the same card combo and even drawing or putting numbers in the same spot on our maps. The goals are just not that varied and there does not seem to be enough penalties for doing something wrong. Will need to give it another play and try the advanced rules.\n\nThe nice theme initially pulls you in, but this game is definitely not perfect and seems like it's been overhyped quite a bit.","user":{"username":"g6grim","id":"zukWhgG8u5"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"I77I9HybTm"}}},{"id":"2DzEFRHaV7","date":"2020-02-06T19:41:33.444Z","rating":4,"title":"My go to r...","description":"My go to roll (flip) and write game that I bring to family get togethers.
