The dynamics were not instantly obvious. Also we generally avoid take that, so some of the capturing strategies probably won't play a big part of our games. I was a little worried that my wife didn't like it, but I could tell later that she was thinking about how to play it for the next time, so I think it is a keeper. Down the line I might try to adjust rules so that some capturing happens automatically, the initial thought is when you use the town center to get your own workers, you have to take half rounded down of anyone else's workers. If this doesn't work, maybe like 1 or something. I am not entirely sure the capturing is necessary, but I felt it appears to be a big part of the game, interrupting the other player's engine.June 2020BoardGameCo $24.26","user":{"username":"Wolfbearheart","id":"h5ZExFcIac"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"omFfdCNOD1"}}},{"id":"z9LNWj8Y6J","date":"2020-07-19T15:39:10.445Z","rating":4,"description":"Solo","user":{"username":"Vucora","id":"Gd7ghgvUUq"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"omFfdCNOD1"}}},{"id":"JvFGckSBuA","date":"2020-03-18T01:43:31.119Z","rating":4,"title":"Weight: 2....","description":"Weight: 2.75 \/ 5Includes promos and tax bin and metal coins","user":{"username":"OdysseusX","id":"P0X8HlAGpi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"omFfdCNOD1"}}},{"id":"IMy2E7eTz4","date":"2020-03-18T00:14:31.946Z","rating":4,"title":"Rating bas...","description":"Rating based on 1st play","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"omFfdCNOD1"}}},{"id":"AKVnPJTj9H","date":"2020-03-09T15:10:23.581Z","rating":3,"title":"Played a h...","description":"Played a half game, I think better with more players.

I like both, but I prefer Architects over (Base) Raiders (the 2 expansions helps Raiders a LOT IMO). To me, this is a great and light worker placement game. I like how you can get more resources by continuing to add more workers to a spot. I also like how Shem found a way to mitigate that by spending an action to imprison other people's workers. I also like how you can +\/- Reputation which can in\/prohibit you from taking certain actions on the board.

The fact others can capture other peoples workers might be off putting to some.\nIt has its issues in terms of balance as well. If say no one but you captures workers, the player who captured them will lose due to tempo loss. If no one captures workers the game will simply be the same but now each player would need to reclaim a worker every turn after. \nMy biggest complaint is that the most generic and simple way of winning the game (working on the cathedral) seems to be the most effective and there is a specific character who does that.\nHowever if you're simply looking to get a casual, slightly different more interactive gameplay where your group isn't afraid of using the capture mechanic then this game is for you.\nAnd yes luck influences this game quite a bit, but without it there would be no replayability.\n\nWill update if the new expansion fixes any of the issues listed above.","user":{"username":"B\u00f3ndi","id":"0Tl225MCLS"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"omFfdCNOD1"}}},{"id":"XiREpwSrWO","date":"2019-11-07T18:15:28.590Z","rating":5,"title":"Worker pla...","description":"Worker placement","user":{"username":"Fizberry","id":"UWSGRbfFGs"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"omFfdCNOD1"}}},{"id":"OFQDnGMG8D","date":"2019-11-06T17:28:10.958Z","rating":4,"title":"I've enjoy...","description":"I've enjoyed it more with a higher player count than 2.","user":{"username":"alchain31","id":"2uV1IA8Vqj"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"omFfdCNOD1"}}},{"id":"FJQkU5PRN6","date":"2019-10-25T19:37:33.380Z","rating":4,"title":"Great twis...","description":"Great twist on worker placement.
