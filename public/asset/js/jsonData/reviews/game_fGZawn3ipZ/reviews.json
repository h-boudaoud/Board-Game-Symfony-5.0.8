I don't give many 10's.  And I never give them out right off the bat.  (I use a different style rating system)  But I love this game.  And the thing about this one is the better you get at it.  The more fun it becomes and the more interesting the situations that you get in get.It is interesting playing this with people and growing as a group, but later, I think playing with others makes the group dynamic kind of interesting as well, and sometimes frustrating.  I'm happy to play this anytime.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"fGZawn3ipZ"}}},{"id":"LgHjhjF0gE","date":"2020-03-24T18:55:26.846Z","rating":3,"title":"Really cle...","description":"Really clever game and perfect for teaching non-gamers!","user":{"username":"guzforster","id":"BXzlhlqwCb"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"fGZawn3ipZ"}}}]
