This is a beast of a game and I understand 100% why it receives all the love it's gotten, but this is a lot tougher than I thought it would be. This is going to take some time to learn and wrap my mind around.","user":{"username":"SteezyStan","id":"q16YP2lDw1"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"GcQt5tSkcS","date":"2020-03-24T18:55:14.015Z","rating":4,"title":"INCREDIBLY...","description":"INCREDIBLY FIDDLY game. So many effects, rules, etc - it takes about an hour to start to play without having to check the rulebook for everything you forget. I would highly recommend to use the now-official helper app, which saves a ton of time in setup, although the app itself is a bit strange and fiddly to use.I love the puzzle aspect from the cards in your hand - that was (to me) obviously referenced by Mage Knight's similar mechanism of card playing.The game is super fun, and managing the scenarios feels awesome because it\u2019s always so close.","user":{"username":"guzforster","id":"BXzlhlqwCb"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"IgeNcTaMFc","date":"2020-03-18T00:40:50.907Z","rating":4,"title":"Rating bas...","description":"Rating based on 1st plays, two with a friend and one with my son. We had fun discovering the game and I'd like to play more, to explore the game and the characters. Will take me quite some time before the solo game is unlocked.Definitely an intriguing game, feels a bit like a video game. A slow starter, but a promising one. Difficult to get this one to the table (as I can't play it solo yet), so considering to trade it away.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"WDvuteA4dh","date":"2020-03-07T03:12:05.684Z","rating":5,"title":"1-4","description":"1-4","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"NYdwSL15oG","date":"2020-03-05T15:08:52.928Z","rating":2,"title":"My buddy o...","description":"My buddy owns this and we were all super pumped to play, but after 4-5 scenarios, we really lost all desire to it play it anymore.","user":{"username":"jasonberube","id":"D7oMBOfsNM"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"ClqQ3NjHzX","date":"2020-03-03T19:13:55.752Z","rating":3,"title":"w\/ Meeple ...","description":"w\/ Meeple Realty Insert and Removable Sticker Set, includes the health\/xp dials (set of 4), solo scenarios, and solo scenario item cards.","user":{"username":"DiggingDice","id":"LdQWFOWDSY"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"cu58vrD2Px","date":"2020-02-26T18:06:37.624Z","rating":3,"title":"2nd Editio...","description":"2nd Edition - Kickstarted!","user":{"username":"xmorridin","id":"bGnYPyAeQi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"no4NJM8nzt","date":"2020-02-06T19:41:14.017Z","rating":4,"title":"A beast to...","description":"A beast to set up, but the rules aren't overly complicated.
