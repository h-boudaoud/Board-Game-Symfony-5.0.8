So many effects, rules, etc - it takes about an hour to start to play without having to check the rulebook for everything you forget. I would highly recommend to use the now-official helper app, which saves a ton of time in setup, although the app itself is a bit strange and fiddly to use.I love the puzzle aspect from the cards in your hand - that was (to me) obviously referenced by Mage Knight's similar mechanism of card playing.The game is super fun, and managing the scenarios feels awesome because it\u2019s always so close.","user":{"username":"guzforster","id":"BXzlhlqwCb"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"IgeNcTaMFc","date":"2020-03-18T00:40:50.907Z","rating":4,"title":"Rating bas...","description":"Rating based on 1st plays, two with a friend and one with my son. We had fun discovering the game and I'd like to play more, to explore the game and the characters. Will take me quite some time before the solo game is unlocked.Definitely an intriguing game, feels a bit like a video game. A slow starter, but a promising one. Difficult to get this one to the table (as I can't play it solo yet), so considering to trade it away.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"WDvuteA4dh","date":"2020-03-07T03:12:05.684Z","rating":5,"title":"1-4","description":"1-4","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"NYdwSL15oG","date":"2020-03-05T15:08:52.928Z","rating":2,"title":"My buddy o...","description":"My buddy owns this and we were all super pumped to play, but after 4-5 scenarios, we really lost all desire to it play it anymore.","user":{"username":"jasonberube","id":"D7oMBOfsNM"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"ClqQ3NjHzX","date":"2020-03-03T19:13:55.752Z","rating":3,"title":"w\/ Meeple ...","description":"w\/ Meeple Realty Insert and Removable Sticker Set, includes the health\/xp dials (set of 4), solo scenarios, and solo scenario item cards.","user":{"username":"DiggingDice","id":"LdQWFOWDSY"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"cu58vrD2Px","date":"2020-02-26T18:06:37.624Z","rating":3,"title":"2nd Editio...","description":"2nd Edition - Kickstarted!","user":{"username":"xmorridin","id":"bGnYPyAeQi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"no4NJM8nzt","date":"2020-02-06T19:41:14.017Z","rating":4,"title":"A beast to...","description":"A beast to set up, but the rules aren't overly complicated.

The scenarios are well-calibrated (challenging but doable), rewards are tough to earn but within sight, and the amount of stuff to do is extraordinary. \nThe core cardplay, which I falsely perceived as giving a sort of timer to the game that I generally don't prefer, is really clever and encourages interesting tradeoffs that culminate in a cinematic orgy of powerful effects.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"AbVWn4gBUo","date":"2020-01-25T00:23:08.899Z","rating":4,"title":"A fantasti...","description":"A fantastic dungeon crawler with deep decision making.

It's a massive game with 100+ hours of content, huge replayability, impressive scalability, and what appears to be a continuous future of exciting material to expand the adventures. As large and overwhelming as Gloomhaven first appears, it's cleverly pieced together and portrayed in extremely clean and simple ways. The gameplay is satisfying and the card management and multiple heroes and enemies allow for a wide array of outcomes and synergies that could never be experienced in a single playthrough.\n\nThe only thing docking a full and final glorious star is the amount of tediousness tied into the nature of this beast. Without an exceptional organizational solution like what Broken Token provides this games setup and tear down would be unbearable. Without elegant digital app solutions for maintaining enemy decks and other items even more time and table space is needed to get through each scenario. If I wasn't playing with an individual who loves managing rules and enemy AI I wouldn't have the patience to figure out how each enemy moves and attacks and in what order and so on and so forth. There's a lot of necessary minutiae that's required to make this game work, and that can be a lot to handle without the right tools and people involved. But if you've got the right group, Gloomhaven is sure to offer dozens of scenarios filled with hours of enjoyable adventures and satisfying experiences.","user":{"username":"Trystonian","id":"XyAVDLeTHK"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RLlDWHh7hR"}}},{"id":"TGJ9faSGH2","date":"2019-12-12T17:36:19.562Z","rating":4,"title":"Wow!
