Love the amount of dice in this game and the size and look of them.  The turn order in the game I like a lot (clockwise then counter clock wise until all play twice). The special paid moves are not used as much when I play and the rules for them are a bit obtuse.","user":{"username":"lanista","id":"E7q1E8FblY"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"mJr3oebP6p"}}},{"id":"pNs6HIGLiv","date":"2020-04-14T20:21:06.591Z","rating":4,"title":"Like Azul,...","description":"Like Azul, but with dice.
