It seems rather complex at first, but it plays rather naturally after a few rounds.In its core this is a card drafting \/ tableau building  game over three phases, where you want to build up your resources at first to be able to build your own economy, military and science and if possible, you personal wonder. To do this, you choose one card to play and pass the other cards to your neighbour. When all the cards are played, then intermediate scoring takes place (on military power) and the next phase starts. After phase 3 the game ends and final scoring takes place.There are several paths that can lead to victory, but it's usually best to focus on one or two routes. Keeping a close eye on your neighbour is very important as you can benefit from his resources, goods and -especially in the last phase- from the cards he\/she has played.All in all, I really like this game. It plays rather fast, so you can play a number of games on a single night. I rate this game 9\/10 and would play this again anytime","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"OF145SrX44"}}},{"id":"HzD3ae7O8m","date":"2020-03-09T23:04:48.036Z","rating":4,"title":"\"A CIV gam...","description":"\"A CIV game for 7 players that is playable in 30 minutes!
