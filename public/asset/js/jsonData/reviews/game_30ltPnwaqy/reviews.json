This game breathes theme and I am very excited about this game. The game is brutal and if the cards are against you, you're unlikely to win this one, but that makes perfect sense in such a brutal environment. Would love to play this more and to introduce this to other players, but the complexity and the length make it hard to get this to the table except solo.Still, a definite keeper in my collection and if it would get more playtime likely to be in my top 10.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"30ltPnwaqy"}}},{"id":"GbUGbXPIkh","date":"2020-03-05T15:09:01.388Z","rating":4,"title":"My wife sa...","description":"My wife says there is too much Alpha-gaming in RC and others say the game is punishing and brutal.

Mechanics get totally in the way of the flow until you know exactly how it goes.  We house rule everything that comes up and research it later, otherwise you're stopping all the time, until you know it all cold.  Tough scenarios - seemingly great replayability. Wife will not play under any circumstances, haha.\n\nUpdate - 6 months in.  Definitely enjoy it, now that the mechanics are second nature.  Love the replay value and the unpredictability.
