Subject to lots of AP, but if you're patient, it's exciting to see your friends freak out about what to play and watch their confidence grow as they analyze all possible outcomes. Beautiful components, perhaps thematically my favorite type of fantasy, and an absolutely wonderful game all around.

The game could be considered a gateway game, but there is quite some strategy involved and at first glance the game may seem overwhelming.The mancala-system is quite different from other games, which is refreshing and it works really well. Turn order is an auction\/bidding, so you have to pay coins (=VP's) to be first in line, so you will not want to spend VP's unnessecary, but you would like to be first or second in line (depending on what's available on the board). If you choose to pay nothing, then you're placed in last position, but everyone after you can also choose to play nothing and move you even further back.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sMTDq4Zeif"}}},{"id":"THV9KH3bJg","date":"2020-03-07T03:12:02.722Z","rating":4,"title":"2-4","description":"2-4","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sMTDq4Zeif"}}},{"id":"5kvWEdZJDr","date":"2020-02-28T01:36:02.625Z","rating":4,"title":"The King o...","description":"The King of ANALYSIS PARALYSIS!

It works as a great bridge from gateway games into meatier ones, without being too heavy. \n\nI love how literally everything is worth points in the game. Even the money is worth points at a one to one ratio, but you use the money to buy everything else. \n\nOnce you've played a few times, the game time drops significantly, and it's a great game to play between heavier euros as a palate cleanser. \n\nThe component quality is excellent, as you would expect from Days of Wonder. The cardboard chits are thick stock, the colours are vibrant. The meeples have little turbans if you look closely. \n\nAll in all, a wonderful game.","user":{"username":"Philcampeau","id":"dmYEzu2sQM"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sMTDq4Zeif"}}},{"id":"ATEUBD74vA","date":"2020-01-15T17:33:27.063Z","rating":4,"title":"Like how t...","description":"Like how the game is all strategy and there is no chance involved (no dice). The bidding phase is very enjoyable. The one negative with this game was the rule book. The first time playing we had to jump on BGG to find an explanation of several rules. (Scoring of the Viziers and if the Fakir's are scored at the end). The \"game turn\" sheet that every player has is not the official rule book. The Viziers's scoring is misleading on the game turn sheet.","user":{"username":"Razcar","id":"DMHhSwkSo1"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sMTDq4Zeif"}}},{"id":"p23fDmvX5z","date":"2020-01-04T04:32:21.587Z","rating":4,"title":"One of our...","description":"One of our first 5 games.
