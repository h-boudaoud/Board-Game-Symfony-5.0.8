Subject to lots of AP, but if you're patient, it's exciting to see your friends freak out about what to play and watch their confidence grow as they analyze all possible outcomes. Beautiful components, perhaps thematically my favorite type of fantasy, and an absolutely wonderful game all around.

The game could be considered a gateway game, but there is quite some strategy involved and at first glance the game may seem overwhelming.The mancala-system is quite different from other games, which is refreshing and it works really well. Turn order is an auction\/bidding, so you have to pay coins (=VP's) to be first in line, so you will not want to spend VP's unnessecary, but you would like to be first or second in line (depending on what's available on the board). If you choose to pay nothing, then you're placed in last position, but everyone after you can also choose to play nothing and move you even further back.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sMTDq4Zeif"}}},{"id":"THV9KH3bJg","date":"2020-03-07T03:12:02.722Z","rating":4,"title":"2-4","description":"2-4","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sMTDq4Zeif"}}}]
