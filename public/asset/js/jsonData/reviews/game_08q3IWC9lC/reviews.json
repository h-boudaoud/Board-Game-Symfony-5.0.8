And it's no longer a CCG, which was my main problem with it the last time I played it.It's a good game.  Fun, entertaining, fairly inexpensive for the amount of game you get in the box.  If you're going to play a CCG Game, I suppose this is one of the better ones to get into.  It has the benefit of being very different based on which side you're playing, and you have to build two decks instead of just one, so there's a lot to explore.  However, playing the game requires constant updates, and keeping up, and just not something I have the time and energy for, I'm out.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"08q3IWC9lC"}}}]
