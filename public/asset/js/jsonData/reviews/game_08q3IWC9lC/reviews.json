And it's no longer a CCG, which was my main problem with it the last time I played it.It's a good game.  Fun, entertaining, fairly inexpensive for the amount of game you get in the box.  If you're going to play a CCG Game, I suppose this is one of the better ones to get into.  It has the benefit of being very different based on which side you're playing, and you have to build two decks instead of just one, so there's a lot to explore.  However, playing the game requires constant updates, and keeping up, and just not something I have the time and energy for, I'm out.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"08q3IWC9lC"}}},{"id":"5ffc5CzQcH","date":"2020-02-28T15:13:04.650Z","rating":3,"title":"If only it...","description":"If only it hadn't been killed off....

A carefully-researched and very thoughtful gift meant to be the backbone of a weekend of celebratory gaming.\n\nDay 1: Excitement (note that no gameplay actually took place on this day)\n\nDay 2: Confusion (\u201cWe have to watch a 20-minute video just to understand the basic jargon? TWICE?\u201d)\n\nDay 3: Anger (\u201cWhy can\u2019t this game just use normal words for anything?\u201d)\n\nThat was the first weekend. We really stuck with it for another couple of weeks by adding custom player aids, doing research online, and trying different configurations of cards. That\u2019s more work than either of us put into our actual relationship so the game has gathered dust ever since. We\u2019re pretty sure that all the reviews saying it\u2019s a great couples game are written by robots from a joyless future where the only game that exists is Android: Netrunner.","user":{"username":"Blap The Smaker","id":"2nAlqZMPU7"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"08q3IWC9lC"}}},{"id":"SFwOEvjnMB","date":"2020-01-28T15:30:57.144Z","rating":4,"title":"The most b...","description":"The most balanced asymmetric game I've ever played.

I didn't really fully understand what that meant when I bought it but I have no intention of keeping up with such an aggressive release schedule and meta game. The idea of deck-building outside of the game does not appeal to me. I would love this as a standalone game like Ashes with fixed decks for each corporation and runner.","user":{"username":"Kbieb","id":"a14hHC8tAx"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"08q3IWC9lC"}}},{"id":"GUqmiS0sjM","date":"2020-01-26T03:17:47.643Z","rating":3,"title":"It is a ga...","description":"It is a game where you want action efficiency, and that's about all there is to the game. Given that that might often rely crucially the order in which you draw your cards, I don't see much to offer here. In short, it is showing its age from back when CCGs were sloppily designed and rather simplistic.\nAnd seriously, the overly baroque terminology is stupid.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"08q3IWC9lC"}}},{"id":"eFkNqiduUs","date":"2020-01-25T10:41:12.855Z","rating":3,"title":"2\n30-60 mi...","description":"2\n30-60 min","user":{"username":"jphyde9","id":"ER1VS6ReGW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"08q3IWC9lC"}}},{"id":"nQTr0PdMCe","date":"2020-01-25T06:23:00.789Z","rating":3,"title":"Love it, b...","description":"Love it, but haven't convinced anybody else to play it with me.\n\n**Update** Everyone decided it's great on their own, so it's getting played again.","user":{"username":"PhaseLoss","id":"t1EMiQJg2a"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"08q3IWC9lC"}}},{"id":"7A0pVljneZ","date":"2020-01-25T00:21:59.644Z","rating":3,"title":"A two-play...","description":"A two-player game that's interesting but more-so in the deck design aspect.
