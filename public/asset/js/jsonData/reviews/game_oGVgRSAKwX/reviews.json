Over the years we've picked up most of the expansions and played it such a lot that we went off it a bit and started to keep it to play when other's insisted on it or to play with non-gamers.  However, we recently picked up the Winter edition to play over Christmas and have re-discovered the simplicity associated in the base game played with just two.****Keeper(s)!!!","user":{"username":"Susie_Cat","id":"rSfEYzMbkT"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"oGVgRSAKwX"}}},{"id":"Kus8HKAcuH","date":"2020-07-30T08:32:56.594Z","rating":3,"description":"I still like the game but I'm a bit burnt out on it now.","user":{"username":"captain pedantic","id":"FfTjPjqFyX"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"oGVgRSAKwX"}}},{"id":"syinG06Ipj","date":"2020-07-24T05:20:39.077Z","rating":3,"description":"iOS","user":{"username":"sangwoko","id":"ASh49hEcAE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"oGVgRSAKwX"}}},{"id":"EIcWZzD4aC","date":"2020-07-20T14:04:53.112Z","rating":5,"description":"A classic for a reason.
