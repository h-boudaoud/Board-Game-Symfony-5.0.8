Maybe 40? 50? It's a lot. I often play it 3-5 times in a row, and have one or two sessions where we played it like 10 times straight (with a \"non-gamer\" group) . . . and then they kept playing after I went to bed!

The Resistance feels more like a logical deduction game dealing with facts and less of the social aspect of reading people. Secret Hitler deals with probabilities and uncertainties with waaaaay more human psychology and soical interactions. As a long time poker player I prefer the latter.\n\nIt's still a game I would never turn down if requested.","user":{"username":"Deucejack","id":"mGrdNHgXEE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"YL5DYnG28Y"}}}]
