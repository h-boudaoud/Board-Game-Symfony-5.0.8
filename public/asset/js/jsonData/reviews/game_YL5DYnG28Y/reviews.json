The Resistance feels more like a logical deduction game dealing with facts and less of the social aspect of reading people. Secret Hitler deals with probabilities and uncertainties with waaaaay more human psychology and soical interactions. As a long time poker player I prefer the latter.\n\nIt's still a game I would never turn down if requested.","user":{"username":"Deucejack","id":"mGrdNHgXEE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"YL5DYnG28Y"}}},{"id":"EvBG5SPmug","date":"2020-01-25T07:11:41.209Z","rating":4,"title":"Expansions...","description":"Expansions:\n- Hidden Agenda\n- Hostile Intent\n- The Plot Thickens\n\nEverybody loves to blame other people as being the spies.

They do feel similar but The Resistance is probably going to be a lot quicker and more engaging on the whole as there isn't player elimination.
