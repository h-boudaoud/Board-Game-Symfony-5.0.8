I think it works quite well, and I'm happy to play it.  I don't see needing both though.  And I think Pandemic is a little less luck reliant after just a couple of plays.  At least, I think there's more time, and planning that can be done in that one.  This game is not bad though, and is a little bit easier on the kids and stuff, has less components, etc.It works quite well for what it is.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8t0Cstr6oX"}}},{"id":"Dx5YC6ySIt","date":"2020-03-24T20:33:59.086Z","rating":2,"title":"Not a fan ...","description":"Not a fan for 'solo' cooperative game.","user":{"username":"princetonwong","id":"62dn1tmxwO"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8t0Cstr6oX"}}},{"id":"qQnwVJe0fT","date":"2020-03-18T00:24:56.538Z","rating":3,"title":"Bought it ...","description":"Bought it in a package, but this one would not hit the table at home or with my friends, so traded it away.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8t0Cstr6oX"}}},{"id":"88bfQ87jpA","date":"2020-03-09T15:10:54.703Z","rating":3,"title":"Co-op, pan...","description":"Co-op, pandemic style.
