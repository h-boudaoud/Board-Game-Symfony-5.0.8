The game has different boards for the various number of players, so it will always be a world too small for everyone, which ensures there's plenty of action  The game looks great and the numerous combinations of races and special powers (which are different every game) ensure that replayability is high.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8UmzC1ZGGE"}}},{"id":"ZyI0aXVJHU","date":"2020-03-04T19:42:40.606Z","rating":3,"title":"i realy wa...","description":"i realy wanted to like this game.. but i hate the downtime between turns.. it realy spoils it for me.  some games have a bearable downtime as they are quite heavy and that's part of the deal.. but this is too light for the down time it has.","user":{"username":"antiussentiment","id":"jqE5Gn3RFW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8UmzC1ZGGE"}}},{"id":"rvgIzDdXCR","date":"2020-02-28T23:04:36.228Z","rating":3,"title":"[SOLD June...","description":"[SOLD June 2017]I like the simplified combat mechanics.  Every game is different due to the huge number of race\/power combinations.  Sure it's chaotic, but that's part of the fun.  I especially like that players are never eliminated; very high revenge factor in this one generates spicy table talk.","user":{"username":"permagoof","id":"EE9k3rx1UU"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8UmzC1ZGGE"}}},{"id":"CA4NdHqXMB","date":"2020-02-26T18:08:45.847Z","rating":4,"title":"Art and th...","description":"Art and theme is awesome.  Easy game to learn and plays fairly quickly.  The race\/trait combos expands the replay value for a long time.Only downside is the box insert.  No clear way to pack everything nice and neat back into the box.  The armies tray does not hold everything evenly and the instruction book diagram for the insert in the back is garbage.","user":{"username":"xmorridin","id":"bGnYPyAeQi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8UmzC1ZGGE"}}},{"id":"UUOds2K5An","date":"2020-02-25T17:57:54.618Z","rating":3,"title":"Good looki...","description":"Good looking, fast. \"Wargame\" that my wife plays (yeah I know its not really a wargame).
