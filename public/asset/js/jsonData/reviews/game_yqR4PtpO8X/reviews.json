Solid 10. It's not a 4X despite the looks. Solid solid worker placement with area control. Tons of different set-ups. Satisfying art. Nice minis (that smell of play-doh!) Once you know what you're doing play is fast fast fast! We can get a 3 or 4 player game done in 60-90 minutes. So satisfying.","user":{"username":"andybeta","id":"iBINPaJZ01"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"yqR4PtpO8X"}}},{"id":"ZuQBwI4qpT","date":"2020-04-01T19:42:52.304Z","rating":3,"title":"This is a ...","description":"This is a solid area control \/ euro game, disguised as a war game.

It took a while to learn, but once you do go through everything the turns are really straightforward.  It's weird how all the boards are different and get mixed\/matched with each game, so it makes it sort of puzzly in what you get and what you can do each game.  Not sure if it makes a huge difference in the end or not.  I wasn't blown away, but the game was pleasant enough though it was slightly long, maybe that speeds up with more play.  I'm interested in exploring this further.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"yqR4PtpO8X"}}},{"id":"fbI81BkdoP","date":"2020-04-01T02:18:41.976Z","rating":4,"title":"Great look...","description":"Great looking components and well thought out gameplay, but it's not as exciting as other games.","user":{"username":"TroyNyne","id":"FEjzD24EeL"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"yqR4PtpO8X"}}},{"id":"X9gk7IdbL4","date":"2020-03-24T18:56:13.681Z","rating":4,"title":"I love tha...","description":"I love that this is a very well thought out strategy game and yet it's easy to learn the rules.

I can perfectly understand the hype, which was primarily based on art work and theme, and as far as I;m concerned the game delivers on its promise. The different factions all have their own unique abilities which make for a different game each play, also combined with the random player board, which calls for a different strategy each play.People looking for a heavy combat game will be dissapointed, as combat is minimal in the game, however the threat of combat is constant, which, in my view, works very well.I've tried a few games against the AI on easy (Autometta) and normal (Automata) level and that's also a nice experience, which allows you experiment a bit with the combinations and strategies. COnsidering to acquire additional Automa packs in orde to play against mutiple AI's. Also might consider buying the expansion, which adds two new factions to the game.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"yqR4PtpO8X"}}},{"id":"hO0NrfN0rI","date":"2020-03-12T20:09:58.667Z","rating":3,"title":"I mainly p...","description":"I mainly play this solo, and it's a really challenging system.  Really good game mechanics, engine building is so fun, the art is amazing, just an overall really good game.

My first real Kickstarter! I was concerned that it wouldn't live up to the hype, but I'm happy to report that it met and exceeded my expectations. This is one of my favorite games right now. I look forward to playing it many more times over the years. July 2016Returned rating to a 10. I've played 6 solo games, which is pushing it back up for me. I don't usually care about solo gaming that much, but with my limited time lately, it's nice to be able to knock out a game in the evening in about 90 minutes including setup and breakdown. August, 2016.I'm still in love with this game. I haven't been able to play for over a month, but still have TWENTY NINE plays so far this year (that's just from late July through late October!). Solo mode has been great. I've also been solo-testing a campaign I've designed, playing 4-player games by myself. I've gotten a ton of use out of this, and I truly regret not going all-in on the Kickstarter. I've ordered the metal coins, and maybe someday I'll get the realistic resources. I love this game so much.

The game is simple to learn and easy to teach others.  It starts slow but ramps up quickly and turns do not take long after the initial rounds.  Only downside is that the game ends rather abruptly.
