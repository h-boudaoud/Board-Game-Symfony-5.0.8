Laget and Cathala, the Arthurian legends are not characterized by betrayal from within apart from Lancelot)--but the roles change things in potentially interesting ways. I'm not 100% sold on Merlin et al, but the roles beat the pants off the execrable Plot cards from the base version. So... kinda the definitive version?","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"unQAllLRup"}}}]
