I was actively avoiding it because of the hype, but the group wanted to play so I relented.  It's fine.  I think the monsters might be unbalanced though, maybe they are not, I would not mind additional plays to explore that.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"qk43alZotU","date":"2020-04-01T02:13:44.168Z","rating":4,"title":"The hype f...","description":"The hype for this game is real.

I love that its not solely based off of confrontation.  I like that is comes down to victory points and their are different paths to victory. The miniatures in this game are amazing! and they would be awesome to paint.  I also enjoy the card combat and that you can buy different gods based on your needs.  fantastically done game!

I have concerns about the cards, though. In principle, yes, drafting should take care of concerns about card balance--but I'm not sure there's much room for hate-drafting in this game. In a game like Fairy Tale, where you will only play 60% of your cards, you could easily hate-draft. But in Blood Rage, you can easily play all of your cards each era, which encourages everyone just maximizing your own strategy's score. If that's true, then I worry that some strategies are vastly superior to others--compare the points for dead dudes vs. ship upgrades, for example.\nBut it's still very fun and it seems to win friends wherever it goes.\n[EDIT] Further evidence seems to be allaying my fears. This sucker appears to have legs.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"Ig634SH3Fe","date":"2020-01-26T00:09:10.432Z","rating":4,"title":"3-5\nBest w...","description":"3-5\nBest with 4\/5","user":{"username":"TalksToChalk","id":"ttBznVfupr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"fyFGtblICx","date":"2020-01-25T05:54:06.964Z","rating":4,"title":"[b][size=1...","description":"[b][size=12][BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0]Sleeved[\/BGCOLOR][\/size][\/b]   [COLOR=#FFFFFF][b][size=12][BGCOLOR=#FF0000]Have Game Want Accessories[\/BGCOLOR][\/size][\/b][\/color]    \n[COLOR=#ffffff][b][size=12][BGCOLOR=#000000]Want 3D Player Board Overlay[\/BGCOLOR][\/size][\/b][\/color]\nincludes Broken Token Insert\nsleeved","user":{"username":"kentdavies","id":"LiAt0DjAeB"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}}]
