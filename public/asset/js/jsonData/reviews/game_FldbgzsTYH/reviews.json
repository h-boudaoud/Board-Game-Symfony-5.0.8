But those are insanely cool too.","user":{"username":"Wyrd","id":"SYE77fvfyX"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"8tZl4CT4XD","date":"2020-04-01T02:36:45.931Z","rating":3,"title":"I was quit...","description":"I was quite surprised by this game.  I was actively avoiding it because of the hype, but the group wanted to play so I relented.  It's fine.  I think the monsters might be unbalanced though, maybe they are not, I would not mind additional plays to explore that.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"qk43alZotU","date":"2020-04-01T02:13:44.168Z","rating":4,"title":"The hype f...","description":"The hype for this game is real.

Next time: take more quests!","user":{"username":"guzforster","id":"BXzlhlqwCb"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"5D2onC7ath","date":"2020-03-18T00:14:57.014Z","rating":4,"title":"Thinking a...","description":"Thinking about it. Played just once and really enjoyed that game, so would like to play again. Still rather expensive, so will not buy anytime soon unless I find a good deal (or 2nd hand).","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"IDuFn67Iae","date":"2020-03-09T23:05:35.384Z","rating":4,"title":"Kickstarte...","description":"Kickstarter edition","user":{"username":"opticode","id":"GOBGDBMHVT"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"q3i03qgHc4","date":"2020-03-07T03:11:44.418Z","rating":4,"title":"2-5","description":"2-5","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FldbgzsTYH"}}},{"id":"dAuwEPIOCe","date":"2020-03-05T15:08:23.785Z","rating":5,"title":"The minis ...","description":"The minis are great. The game play is great. I love the theme (big Viking fan).
