Then it was a dance to see how to work out getting a white worker after you accumulate the materials necessary to conduct a raid on one of the few remaining raid locations. And then watch as your opponent gets there the turn before you, ending the game (as she was the last player in turn order). There needs to be a better way to get points from the Village if you don't have the materials to raid (or the right color worker) or you don't have a way to gather the materials for an offering. The end-game just felt way too restricting. Otherwise, I thought it was a fun game.","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"3tAwjRDw8q"}}},{"id":"rjWLkesVFE","date":"2020-03-18T01:49:03.433Z","rating":4,"title":"Weight: 2....","description":"Weight: 2.67 \/ 5Includes Collectors boxIncludes runesaga extra cardsHave spare parts for color matching","user":{"username":"OdysseusX","id":"P0X8HlAGpi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"3tAwjRDw8q"}}},{"id":"ySWQ4hAxHC","date":"2020-03-18T00:43:14.496Z","rating":4,"title":"Preordered...","description":"Preordered - Kickstarter via FB Pledge","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"3tAwjRDw8q"}}},{"id":"Fxuj0qbXUp","date":"2020-03-05T15:08:59.271Z","rating":4,"title":"Worker pla...","description":"Worker placement.
