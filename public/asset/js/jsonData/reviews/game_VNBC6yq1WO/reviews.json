It is Feld's best game by a long shot IMHO.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VNBC6yq1WO"}}},{"id":"nLcWHMFW7Q","date":"2020-08-01T18:37:19.147Z","rating":5,"description":"This game does live up to the hype.

This game is so well liked universally, yet it simply did not click with me. What soured me more than the art was the way buildings worked. The buildings each have their own special power, which meant that it was impossible to play without having the manual in hand. This ruined the game for me.","user":{"username":"tylrprtr","id":"DpO6OsMpCQ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VNBC6yq1WO"}}},{"id":"U3cbF4eZBH","date":"2020-04-01T02:53:38.743Z","rating":3,"title":"I was not ...","description":"I was not really liking this game at all until I realized near the end we were playing a fairly critical rule wrong regarding player turn order.  Now I think I might actually enjoy it.  It's still the typical Feld games of late, so I don't think it'll be a huge hit, but it doesn't seem like it'll be that bad a game in the end.Tentative 5 now, may move to 7 or 3 depending upon how the next games go.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VNBC6yq1WO"}}},{"id":"xwt0wagr84","date":"2020-04-01T02:24:12.418Z","rating":4,"title":"Wow.

The mechanics are amazing. Lots of ways to score that get your brain working. It's not perfect, though. I dislike having to remember what each of the buildings does. The setup takes a bit long having to flip all the tokens. The length of the game is a bit too much as well and for that reason I prefer this with 2 players.","user":{"username":"g6grim","id":"zukWhgG8u5"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VNBC6yq1WO"}}},{"id":"DMbGe8qsfT","date":"2020-02-02T10:06:31.727Z","rating":4,"title":"This was t...","description":"This was the first game I played at a local meetup.
