This one does stand out with an interesting timing mechanic of placing your workers and deciding to let them ride to more powerful actions or pull them off and get them on other things.It was alright, but I didn't see anything in it that made it mind blowing.

As you're only allowed to either place or take off meeples in your turn, timing is probably more important here than in any other game I know. An additional factor too add some complexity is the starting player space. When you claim this you receive all the food (corn) which was placed there in previous turns, but also you have the opportunity to turn the wheels twice instead of once, which can seriously mess with other players plans.Every cart wheel has it's own purpose: food and wood, resources, development and buildings, trade and workers and lastly offerings to the gods. Basically, you need everything and can't neglect any wheel, but the number of workers is very limited and like I said, you can only put workers on one or more wheels or take them off. As the longer they remain on the wheel, the better the reward, so you'd like to keep all of them on as long as possible, which you can't. This part is soooo hard to master, and I'm still learning with every game.To summarize, this game is highly recommended and has been in my top 10 for a couple of years now.Can't wait to play again","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"aD2aeY8DEP"}}},{"id":"Zqfhw8BOfz","date":"2020-03-02T19:55:10.789Z","rating":3,"title":"Started tr...","description":"Started tracking games late.

This game reminded me of a more complex Stone Age that has removed the dice. There are different resources that need converting, buildings to build, and grunts to feed. I have a few hesitations about how the currency (i.e., corn) affect game play, which is why I rated this a 7, but I could see raising the score to an 8 after exploring the game more.\nThoughts after the first play. \n\nPROS\n-The board, with its moving gears, is incredibly unique. It\u2019s hard to think of a regular board game with a more interesting presence. In terms of components, the crystal skulls stand out while the other cube resources are satisfactory. \n-Big, big fan of the artistic style of the game. \n-The different paths to explore\u2014corn, skulls, buildings, monuments, temples, and technology\u2014keep the game from getting stale and let advanced players explore untried strategies while playing with inexperienced players.\n-The starting tiles are excellent! I love the idea that these aid your decision in which strategy you will take.\n\nCONS\n-Corn is a constant and sometimes insurmountable problem. In our game, not one player got another worker for fear of having to feed him. I managed to grab the farm tile that allows a player to feed three of workers and I believe this is the reason I won. In order to stay afloat, it seems that you have to have a worker on the corn wheel at all times and you have to have the tech that allows you to harvest from exhausted fields. I could see gathering sufficient corn limiting a player\u2019s enjoyment of the game as it is such a central focus but also a boring chore when compared with all of the other interesting actions you want to be taking. \n-While focusing on corn, you also need to be amassing cube resources but the wheel where you do this offers infuriatingly few cubes. This seemingly means you need to decide if you want to go for buildings OR monuments but I would be hard pressed to see how you could do both as monuments are incredibly exorbitant. Again, not one player was able to purchase a monument.","user":{"username":"gidorah","id":"asfNJJc1Lr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"aD2aeY8DEP"}}},{"id":"09rA3j2TQj","date":"2019-10-17T14:27:22.852Z","rating":2,"title":"Gift from ...","description":"Gift from Sam, Nov. 2014.","user":{"username":"indigopotter","id":"fdFvxs6OrD"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"aD2aeY8DEP"}}},{"id":"ZnfB32TrhE","date":"2019-09-30T15:14:23.141Z","rating":4,"title":"2-4 Player...","description":"2-4 Players\n90 Minutes","user":{"username":"JohnMunsch","id":"HcGw7lC0za"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"aD2aeY8DEP"}}},{"id":"BnBphVbMIA","date":"2019-04-12T18:22:13.223Z","rating":3,"title":"The gears ...","description":"The gears in this game add some complexity to a worker placement game.
