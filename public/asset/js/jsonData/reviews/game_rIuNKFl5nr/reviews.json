I can't decide if it's incredibly intricate or just slightly random. It feels like you don't have much agency, but I suspect this is just because I'm not good at the game.\n\nExample:\nI recently played a game where I thoroughly destroyed everyone after the first few rounds. I'm ahead by at least 50 points. But this means everyone else starts making ridiculous amounts of money for being behind me and I can't afford anything in the last round or two. Even so, I'm generating way more points than everyone else. But all that money I flooded into the game turned into points at the end and I lose by 4.

The first part is the sales phase (auction is not quite right) and the second is the tile placement phase. While on the surface that seems like it wouldn't work or, at best, be disjointed, it's surprisingly smooth. I like how you've got a bit of player interaction in the sales and then a bit of navel-gazing in the tile placement. \n\nA couple of notes from a recent play:\n-Everyone thought the game ended a round too soon. Several players mentioned that they would like one more round where all the bonuses scored.\n-After playing at both 3 and 4 players, I think 3 is the ideal player count. With 4, it is too difficult to both consider your own strategy and get a sense of what other players need or guess what they will offer up.\n-Still a bit confused by the scroll scoring. Need to read the rules more clearly on that.\n\nThis is still a game I would like to have in my collection but I don't absolutely need it.","user":{"username":"gidorah","id":"asfNJJc1Lr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"rIuNKFl5nr"}}},{"id":"BEhk3PKjL7","date":"2019-10-18T17:04:10.196Z","rating":3,"title":"If you lov...","description":"If you love Carcassonne and looking for a game to replace it, this is not.
