Coming from an RPG world, It was easy to get into. I had a great time playing as the overlord \/ empire (being a GM, this was also an easy transition). I was ecstatic when Legends of the Alliance finally came out. Thanks FF, you made my year!Components are top notch, game play is fast and easy (again, coming from an RPG world), and setting is great.","user":{"username":"Vucora","id":"Gd7ghgvUUq"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"inwR6DF3Lx"}}},{"id":"6bGb9s98EH","date":"2020-05-01T21:47:14.828Z","rating":4,"title":"This is a ...","description":"This is a test.","user":{"username":"tester","id":"NYPHxA4vGH"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"inwR6DF3Lx"}}},{"id":"wcZYCa8B6Y","date":"2020-04-12T13:36:54.207Z","rating":4,"title":"Very hot i...","description":"Very hot in our house at the moment. We enjoy the skirmish and campaign versions. It is good how we can setup for just a mission\/skirmish battle. It\u2019s only an hour or so, yet it is still part of something bigger.....More of a hit with us boys (the Star Wars fans). Cath tolerates but does not find it as exciting as many of our other games. It a video game in a box for the boys. Different skills, levelling up, expansions, loot and new things to buy as the campaign progresses.The expansions are good, they do add to the game. They\u2019re good stocking fillers, they add new missions, new maps and more command cards for the skirmish. I think will reinvigorate this game as we progress through the missions. The game is fine with just the core set, but what Star Wars fan would stop there anyway?!?","user":{"username":"NeilGordon","id":"Ahchq6lnef"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"inwR6DF3Lx"}}},{"id":"oWgOR8R0Xj","date":"2020-04-12T13:36:54.154Z","rating":4,"title":"Very hot i...","description":"Very hot in our house at the moment.
