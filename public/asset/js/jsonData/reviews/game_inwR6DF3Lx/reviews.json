Coming from an RPG world, It was easy to get into. I had a great time playing as the overlord \/ empire (being a GM, this was also an easy transition). I was ecstatic when Legends of the Alliance finally came out. Thanks FF, you made my year!Components are top notch, game play is fast and easy (again, coming from an RPG world), and setting is great.","user":{"username":"Vucora","id":"Gd7ghgvUUq"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"inwR6DF3Lx"}}},{"id":"6bGb9s98EH","date":"2020-05-01T21:47:14.828Z","rating":4,"title":"This is a ...","description":"This is a test.","user":{"username":"tester","id":"NYPHxA4vGH"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"inwR6DF3Lx"}}},{"id":"wcZYCa8B6Y","date":"2020-04-12T13:36:54.207Z","rating":4,"title":"Very hot i...","description":"Very hot in our house at the moment.

It a video game in a box for the boys. Different skills, levelling up, expansions, loot and new things to buy as the campaign progresses.The expansions are good, they do add to the game. They\u2019re good stocking fillers, they add new missions, new maps and more command cards for the skirmish. I think will reinvigorate this game as we progress through the missions.

I think the battle system is balanced and is great for dice mitigation.  I love that the rebels have these crazy abilities, but still have a tough time with the empire.  I LOVE DMing for the game, playing as the empire and deciding the course of the game and when to do what is an awesome roll.  Fantastic game I don't see my love for this game stopping, and duh it's Star Wars!","user":{"username":"wallawalla4591","id":"8BduD9e5gV"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"inwR6DF3Lx"}}},{"id":"pzXBZRChEA","date":"2020-01-30T17:15:28.548Z","rating":4,"title":"This is a ...","description":"This is a LOT of game.
