This is the game that made me fall in love with this hobby and I still think it's a fantastic game. It's full of tense decisions and interesting moments. And I think it's aging well.

Fantastic blend of long term strategy and short term urgency. Even in the basic game, without cards, there are lots of different avenues to success. We've seen players win with only 3 family members, and we've seen players win with a wood home. We've seen players win by carefully building and sustaining a food engine, and we've seen players fish all the way to victory.\n\nAnd then, once you are comfortable with the basic game, you can add 7 occupations and 7 minor improvements for each player (out of several decks that contain hundreds of unique cards) that will make each game completely different.\n\nIt's precisely those decks of cards and the harsher feeding what, for me, elevates Agricola heads and shoulders over Caverna.","user":{"username":"apertotes","id":"7lwtCGdS6p"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"M5treAlrHc"}}},{"id":"adVABtkQ2V","date":"2019-10-25T19:37:18.870Z","rating":4,"title":"Resource b...","description":"Resource building and worker placement with a huge variety from game to game.  Many ways to victory and many tough decisions throughout the game. Expands very well across number of players and even plays solitaire.  Two reasons why the game is not a 10 though. First, the game can get a little long with 4 or 5 players. Second - and most important - the variability of the occupations and minor improvements can give one player a big [dis]advantage.\n\nINCLUDED:\nAgricola: The Goodies Expansion","user":{"username":"ccmonter","id":"sJFzVKgdg1"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"M5treAlrHc"}}},{"id":"S8cnSaKEIi","date":"2019-10-21T04:24:08.473Z","rating":4,"title":"I love how...","description":"I love how tight this game is.
