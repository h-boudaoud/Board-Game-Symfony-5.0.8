Agricola is the essential backbreaking euro. Can you feed all of your people?...not really, but somehow you do it. I love how hard the choices are in this game and how well the player interaction works in accordance with that. I prefer this to the looser system of Caverna.  *All plays tracked under original version.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"M5treAlrHc"}}},{"id":"CSA9L8VCU9","date":"2020-07-26T11:36:03.347Z","rating":4,"description":"Location: Kallax","user":{"username":"lexjudex","id":"CGBCFjYBAn"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"M5treAlrHc"}}}]
