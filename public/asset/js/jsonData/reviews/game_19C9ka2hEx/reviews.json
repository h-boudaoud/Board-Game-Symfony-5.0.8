I dont especially like social deduction games but i do really enjoy some of the strategies that come out once you wrap your head around the abilities of the different cards. Even at 2 players which you wouldnt necessarily think would work for a social deduction game its still very fun and has some nice \"Take That\" elements .","user":{"username":"Denomfug","id":"1LxSbLd0YD"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"19C9ka2hEx"}}},{"id":"ChDkXOnDDc","date":"2020-04-01T02:40:13.635Z","rating":1,"title":"I've playe...","description":"I've played this several times now, I don't get it. So you can bluff different actions and you may or may not get called out on them, and in the end it comes down to counting what's left, and making a calculated risk on whether or not to call someone's bluff or rebluff a different role on your own.Much better with 5 or 6, I wouldn't play it with less, too many cards stuck in the middle.I'd play it, but only cuz it's super fast, I'm not going to ask for this to be played.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"19C9ka2hEx"}}},{"id":"tK6ObyXMEA","date":"2020-03-18T00:21:26.542Z","rating":3,"title":"Played onc...","description":"Played once, was allright.
