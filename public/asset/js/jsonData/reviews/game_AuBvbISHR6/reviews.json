Like this game a lot. the actions are quick, just 3 types of actions, and you never wait for the other player more than a few seconds. That's great! it's your turn again in no time. Good gateway game. like the expansions too, but the original is the best.","user":{"username":"fzerorubigd","id":"2WmvkhpCwW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"AuBvbISHR6"}}}]
