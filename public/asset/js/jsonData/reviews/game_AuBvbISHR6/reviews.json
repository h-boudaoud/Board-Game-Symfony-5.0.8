Like this game a lot. the actions are quick, just 3 types of actions, and you never wait for the other player more than a few seconds. That's great! it's your turn again in no time. Good gateway game. like the expansions too, but the original is the best.","user":{"username":"fzerorubigd","id":"2WmvkhpCwW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"AuBvbISHR6"}}},{"id":"DKZ7AVPk9g","date":"2020-04-12T13:37:06.405Z","rating":5,"title":"This game ...","description":"This game never fails to be a winner, almost everyone who we play this with goes out and gets themselves a copy.Good duration (30-45mins), plays well with 2, easy to explain and learn for beginners, tense start to finish (building quickly towards the end),  enough luck that beginners have a chance, while still allowing strategies to support a good score.Highly recommended as a gateway game and as a gift.","user":{"username":"NeilGordon","id":"Ahchq6lnef"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"AuBvbISHR6"}}},{"id":"cSKWYxerEx","date":"2020-04-12T13:37:06.344Z","rating":5,"title":"This game ...","description":"This game never fails to be a winner, almost everyone who we play this with goes out and gets themselves a copy.Good duration (30-45mins), plays well with 2, easy to explain and learn for beginners, tense start to finish (building quickly towards the end),  enough luck that beginners have a chance, while still allowing strategies to support a good score.Highly recommended as a gateway game and as a gift.","user":{"username":"NeilGordon","id":"Ahchq6lnef"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"AuBvbISHR6"}}},{"id":"MnI1IulCzG","date":"2020-04-12T00:32:49.014Z","rating":4,"title":"Spiel des ...","description":"Spiel des Jahres, Winner - 2004 * New game that people say will be game of the year in many more contests.  After reading the reviews I dropped two other train games from my list.  This sounds like a good strategy game but not hard to learn.

Could be because I won in my first game (against 3 other players)!  But, after playing Thurn & Taxis, I didn't think TTR would be as entertaining.  Well, it isn't quite as fun, but it was still pretty good.  The game offers enough options to keep it from being completely out of the players' control.  And, being a light game, it doesn't drag on too long.  The hidden VPs in the route cards really make it a good game, rather than a decent one.Like other light, gateway games, this one will be fun to play once in a while.  Being the gamer that I am, I will want to play meatier games more often.","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"AuBvbISHR6"}}}]
