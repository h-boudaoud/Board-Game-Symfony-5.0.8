Uh, this one is a winner.After a bit of time, it kind of loses its luster a bit.  Because it's so small, nearly every interaction is seen after only a few games, then you're just kind of going through the motions at that point.  It's still fine mainly because it's so short, but it just doesn't have enough oomph to keep it around or make it a staple.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"T5lx9elSDt"}}},{"id":"pKzZWgMKai","date":"2020-04-01T02:18:05.683Z","rating":4,"title":"+ Letters ...","description":"+ Letters to Santa","user":{"username":"TroyNyne","id":"FEjzD24EeL"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"T5lx9elSDt"}}},{"id":"YJcycVUG5B","date":"2020-03-24T21:10:15.953Z","rating":4,"title":"(Rating ba...","description":"(Rating based on the first play, subject to change.)","user":{"username":"joeaar","id":"pV9nLlKU68"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"T5lx9elSDt"}}}]
