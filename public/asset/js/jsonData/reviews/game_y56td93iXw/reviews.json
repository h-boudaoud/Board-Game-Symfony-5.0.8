I enjoy anything that creates interesting and unpredictable interactions between people. Each character having their own objective is a great way to spread distrust. Lots of variable player  powers and hidden hands prevents quarter-backing and we always play that with the crossroads cards you don't describe exactly what will happen mechanically, just the narrative always makes it more tense. Love being the traitor but also really enjoy being a regular person as the game gives you plenty of choose even then.","user":{"username":"Courageous Bob","id":"vYQtEV9o0A"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"y56td93iXw"}}},{"id":"MGnwyhayIk","date":"2020-04-14T20:18:11.823Z","rating":3,"title":"Wonderful ...","description":"Wonderful game with a pain-in-the-ass setup, but well worth if you have an invested group of gamers. Thematically on key, visually appealing, and great quality of components. Not my favorite, but a gem in its own right.","user":{"username":"SteezyStan","id":"q16YP2lDw1"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"y56td93iXw"}}},{"id":"lZs5QZteE5","date":"2020-04-02T01:43:39.033Z","rating":4,"title":"In love wi...","description":"In love with this game.
