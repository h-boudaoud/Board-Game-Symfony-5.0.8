I wouldn't call it amazing or anything just yet.  But we'll see I guess.  Maybe it will be more amazing later.It is compelling playing a game not knowing what is coming but knowing that something is.  You don't get that kind of experience from games very often.2017-07: We've finally finished the game, and while I enjoyed the experience, it is mostly pandemic, with an overarching storyline.  Although many of the plot elements were interesting, and I enjoyed going through them.  In the end, during the final stretch, the game started to feel samey, and if it were a great game, that would be fine, but like I said, I wouldn't call it amazing.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"mce5HZPnF5"}}},{"id":"GBPTX22Vlg","date":"2020-04-01T02:18:26.861Z","rating":5,"title":"Takes a de...","description":"Takes a dedicated group to play all the way through this, but we enjoyed the whole ride.

Overall, it was a very good experience and I was very happy to have played it. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Still on the fence whether I should try Season 2 as well given the mixed messages. Also, playing a full campaign requires a lot of commitment as well as time and there are so many other games I want to play as well (including other campaign games). Therefore, will not acquire S2 just yet.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"mce5HZPnF5"}}},{"id":"hPKLwUSZXs","date":"2020-03-11T17:06:41.886Z","rating":5,"title":"Amazing co...","description":"Amazing co-operative experience, definitely worth the investment.","user":{"username":"redrooster555","id":"0oK9LLTONU"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"mce5HZPnF5"}}},{"id":"4ajqWqC8GK","date":"2020-03-07T03:12:15.372Z","rating":4,"title":"Blue","description":"Blue","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"mce5HZPnF5"}}},{"id":"DT6NGspmHW","date":"2020-02-26T18:08:29.883Z","rating":4,"title":"Love playi...","description":"Love playing this with my family.","user":{"username":"xmorridin","id":"bGnYPyAeQi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"mce5HZPnF5"}}}]
