As you need to be close to other players, more players would be better than just two. This also depends on your race of course.Have found a good online platform to play this. Although poor graphics, gameplay is quite alright.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}},{"id":"F3k49SNHeB","date":"2020-03-07T03:12:38.526Z","rating":3,"title":"2-5","description":"2-5","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}},{"id":"ryZ3hLCOPc","date":"2020-03-05T15:09:07.460Z","rating":3,"title":"Had to buy...","description":"Had to buy the app on iPhone to understand this game before I broke it out for my group.

Start was really bumpy and I was really just waiting for the end of it. At one point is suddenly all clicked and it was fun and tense from that point on. All the diffrent races and possibilities just intrigue me even more.

Sure, the different races change the variables involved in said calculations, but in the end it's the same. I prefer a game where you can build an engine that really sings, and\/or you feel like you've accomplished something substantial at the end.\nWell-designed, but short of truly exceptional.\n[EDIT] Yeah, a little too scripted, a little too unbalanced, a little too long.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}},{"id":"0oMVO8buoD","date":"2020-01-25T03:09:37.248Z","rating":4,"title":"2.5\nxx","description":"2.5\nxx","user":{"username":"Arcshot","id":"Xpnrl5RFHA"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}},{"id":"UUZVgH9dTF","date":"2020-01-25T00:25:39.738Z","rating":5,"title":"Highly com...","description":"Highly complex Euro with constantly fascinating decisions. It's competitive but not aggressive. I rarely give 10's, but this game is fantastic and I genuinely believe I'll always love it.\n\nTM vs Gaia: Get TM if you want something a bit tighter with fewer options. Get Gaia if you want more ability to chain moves together in interesting ways. I personally prefer Gaia, but they're similar enough that it's just a small matter of preference. (Also TM supports 5 players, and Gaia supports 1 player.)","user":{"username":"warder57","id":"iaobIrOTQm"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}},{"id":"XNm3dMjKnj","date":"2020-01-24T22:56:23.055Z","rating":4,"title":"2-5p\nAll c...","description":"2-5p\nAll contents in base game box.","user":{"username":"saxsoulo","id":"fjfQxfGyjw"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}},{"id":"XNbjd2zszl","date":"2020-01-24T17:53:07.834Z","rating":3,"title":"Didn't lov...","description":"Didn't love it.","user":{"username":"lorojoro","id":"CrimsRv3ks"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}},{"id":"eimDXXCOU2","date":"2020-01-12T14:15:41.064Z","rating":4,"title":"MM Ding an...","description":"MM Ding and Dent $40","user":{"username":"JHagedorn0125","id":"e9xLHl0h0Y"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"sxLwbJHu77"}}}]
