There is very little to dislike about Concordia - a top game for me.  9\/2019 Update: After a bunch of plays this has actually decreased for me. I like this, but I think the scoring just doesn't click enough for me to really love it as much as I want to.7\/20 Update: I ticked it back up a bit. I still really love this and think it is in the top tier of euro games. Have come back to it and am finding new love for it.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FCuXPSfhDR"}}},{"id":"jqPBg55wlA","date":"2020-08-01T07:24:35.411Z","rating":5,"description":"I would always rather play Brass, unless I'd been playing too much Brass recently--in which case I'd love me some Concordia.The cards are what make this so much fun, and the cards introduced in the Venus expansion are an absolutely essential addition, in my opinion.The amount that you can shaft your opponents is minimal, with the game instead offering you much more clever ways of profiting from your opponents moves. That's what I love about the game--you don't maximise value at the expense of others, but as a peripheral addition to their gains.Peaceful, thoughtful, and very pretty. An exquisite game that is sure to please.","user":{"username":"Perchy","id":"XyM3iXdu83"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FCuXPSfhDR"}}},{"id":"3ybKkAyprO","date":"2020-07-20T14:03:27.839Z","rating":4,"description":"Only played 2 player and thought it was my kind of game with the card play etc. Needs some more to get the seal of approval in my book.","user":{"username":"Jon Dante","id":"x2tLaqb9Tw"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FCuXPSfhDR"}}},{"id":"lLyMCVHJOa","date":"2020-07-15T18:55:46.928Z","rating":4,"description":"Includes Salsa expansion","user":{"username":"truthwritten","id":"g3u3awmgbH"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"FCuXPSfhDR"}}},{"id":"BY758CGWRZ","date":"2020-05-26T16:36:05.545Z","rating":4,"title":"Instant Classic","description":"My wife: \"I can see why people talk about this game even after all this time.\" Simple rules, simple turns, but as the game progresses, the game reveals a surprising amount of depth.
