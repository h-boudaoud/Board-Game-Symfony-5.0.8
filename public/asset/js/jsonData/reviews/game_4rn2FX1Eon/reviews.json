When i played it with friends it was... fine. I enjoyed myself but it felt like a lesser pandemic and if it disappeared from my life it would be okay. THEN i played it with my nephews; and they loved it. I had so much fun playing with them, probably more fun than i ever did playing pandemic on more serious \"gamer\" nights. They loved the treasures, and flippng the cards as they sank, i did have to change the rules a bit to make it easier for them to grasp (i didnt put in hand limits) but i cannot recommend this highly enough for people with younger kids.","user":{"username":"MJay1010","id":"RoZTbOrGyk"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"4rn2FX1Eon"}}},{"id":"N3ljQAfPQt","date":"2020-04-15T01:59:07.463Z","rating":4,"title":"Don\u2019t forbid it!","description":"One of the best little co-op games, great for a family of any ages.

Also, being a teacher, Forbidden island is a lot easier to pull out with my younger students.  The biggest draw back is I feel it is a lot easier to suffer from an alpha gamer in this game rather than other co-op games.","user":{"username":"wallawalla4591","id":"8BduD9e5gV"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"4rn2FX1Eon"}}},{"id":"AI5Vpisjae","date":"2020-01-26T03:45:27.717Z","rating":2,"title":"Pandemic d...","description":"Pandemic does a number of clever things to make you forget you're just hanging around waiting for the cards you need to cure something; Forbidden Island lacks these things. As such, you just hang around waiting for the cards you need.\nThat said, the sinking island mechanic is perhaps marginally better than Pandemic's cube spread--so there is something nifty. That, and the incredibly gorgeous components.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"4rn2FX1Eon"}}},{"id":"A9gmAJqLAB","date":"2020-01-25T10:33:38.341Z","rating":3,"title":"It was a n...","description":"It was a nice puzzle the first few playthroughs but it doesn't give me any reason to want to continue playing after beating it a couple times.","user":{"username":"Deucejack","id":"mGrdNHgXEE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"4rn2FX1Eon"}}}]
