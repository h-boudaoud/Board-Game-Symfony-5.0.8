The way goal cards come out is a bit too random, I feel like it holds this game back from being better.

I love the quality of this game, the relative simplicity, and the vibrant color pallete. Some pieces of bamboo don't fit into each other, but it's not really a problem. On a side note, the copy I purchased came with one of the panda's ears broken off. I emailed Bombyx (or Matagot, I can't remember), and they were INCREDIBLY quick to have another sent out to me, free of charge. I was impressed beyond comprehension.","user":{"username":"SteezyStan","id":"q16YP2lDw1"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"wrEoWdWxVq"}}},{"id":"9LGe78D8Xz","date":"2020-04-14T20:21:37.777Z","rating":3,"title":"One of my ...","description":"One of my first purchases after Splendor.
