The game is fun, tense, and fast. Viticulture is held back from a higher score because of how painfully generic it feels. Stonemaier entered an already saturated genre and made a game that goes beyond doing nothing new, and treads into derivative territory. I also suspect that the efficiency puzzle will lose it's flavour after a few games. It's hard to deny Viticulture's level of execution, but it's equally hard to appreciate it's ambitions.","user":{"username":"Bryle","id":"lLhNFG8GGJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"7NYbgH2Z2I"}}},{"id":"tYuiRfDlET","date":"2020-04-01T02:54:17.656Z","rating":3,"title":"This was a...","description":"This was a good worker placement game.

I love some of the unique components and I love the \"seasonal\" element to the worker placement mechanism.\n\nHowever, every time I sit down to play I seem to forget that this game is a card game cleverly disguised as a board game. I have yet to see someone win simply by building up their fields and delivering orders through the standard worker placement mechanisms. Instead, to win this game one MUST work any special action cards to their advantage to maximize their point potential. In fact, I have seen players win without delivering a single order. It's that part that sometimes has me walking away a little disappointed because for me it breaks the theme just enough to make me feel like I had the better wine producing vineyard, but an opposing player just got the right card at the right time to win. \n\nI've also had a couple wins where it felt cheap because I drew the card that pushed me over the edge on a final turn, meaning that the strategy that led me to that point was secondary to the simple luck of the draw.","user":{"username":"AoBJoe","id":"jMaZmBAScg"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"7NYbgH2Z2I"}}},{"id":"aTeia85UPX","date":"2019-12-20T16:32:08.583Z","rating":5,"title":"Best: 3-4\n...","description":"Best: 3-4\nTime: 45-90 Min\nWeight: 2.94","user":{"username":"grossnasty","id":"D0Pz7AZC9D"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"7NYbgH2Z2I"}}},{"id":"LcBCHbGa47","date":"2019-12-12T17:38:33.726Z","rating":3,"title":"Easy smoot...","description":"Easy smooth game play.
