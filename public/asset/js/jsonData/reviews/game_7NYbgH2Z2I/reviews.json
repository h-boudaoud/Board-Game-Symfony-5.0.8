Edit: I LOVED this game as a two player game. Absolutely wonderful - allows for more thought out turns. Went from questionable to staple in my collection.","user":{"username":"SteezyStan","id":"q16YP2lDw1"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"7NYbgH2Z2I"}}},{"id":"78LafvXnzw","date":"2020-04-14T20:23:07.820Z","rating":4,"title":"Haven't pl...","description":"Haven't played yet - but beautiful game with wonderful components, and an amazing theme.

The game is fun, tense, and fast. Viticulture is held back from a higher score because of how painfully generic it feels. Stonemaier entered an already saturated genre and made a game that goes beyond doing nothing new, and treads into derivative territory. I also suspect that the efficiency puzzle will lose it's flavour after a few games. It's hard to deny Viticulture's level of execution, but it's equally hard to appreciate it's ambitions.","user":{"username":"Bryle","id":"lLhNFG8GGJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"7NYbgH2Z2I"}}},{"id":"tYuiRfDlET","date":"2020-04-01T02:54:17.656Z","rating":3,"title":"This was a...","description":"This was a good worker placement game.  Nothing special but better than most that I've played, and I really enjoy the wine aging mechanic that is involved with this one.  This is probably near the top of my worker placement games that I want to play.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"7NYbgH2Z2I"}}},{"id":"FmjgA48K8Q","date":"2020-03-24T18:56:30.653Z","rating":4,"title":"One of my ...","description":"One of my favorite worker placement games.
