It's a little less interactive with other people (i.e. more multiplayer solitaire than suburbia), but worlds less fiddly on the scoring.Still has that big time random rewards on the bonus scoring though, almost too much. Only more games can flesh that out though.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RvQRrz0gEL"}}},{"id":"QJ6OUN6r75","date":"2020-03-18T01:44:40.376Z","rating":4,"title":"Weight: 2....","description":"Weight: 2.67 \/ 5Includes custom bag for tilesiOS app also purchased","user":{"username":"OdysseusX","id":"P0X8HlAGpi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RvQRrz0gEL"}}},{"id":"rvP0pxLXCC","date":"2020-03-18T00:18:00.106Z","rating":3,"title":"Ted Alspac...","description":"Ted Alspach (Suburbia), same mechanics, but with castle building. Main difference is the auction mechanic. Each round, the start player\/build master sets the prices for the various rooms and the other players then choose one room and pay the costs to the build master. Personally, I like Suburbia better as the auction mechanic results in substantial down time. Of course, it depends on the group.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RvQRrz0gEL"}}},{"id":"wpVLRqGpu2","date":"2020-02-24T19:34:40.345Z","rating":3,"title":"with the c...","description":"with the crowdfunding extras including the Polish castles mini expansion","user":{"username":"steckman","id":"krtTYmDgdE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RvQRrz0gEL"}}},{"id":"qxO1Tt6cPn","date":"2020-01-26T19:04:36.374Z","rating":3,"title":"I really l...","description":"I really like Suburbia by the same designer, but this one does not resonate as much with me.

But it is undeniably extremely fun building your mad little castle; a shame that there isn't more nuance to the pricing, and that optimal play might just require endless perusal of difficult-to-read opponents' castles.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RvQRrz0gEL"}}},{"id":"ePjXFKJ1yH","date":"2020-01-26T00:09:33.289Z","rating":3,"title":"2-4\nBest w...","description":"2-4\nBest with 3\/4","user":{"username":"TalksToChalk","id":"ttBznVfupr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RvQRrz0gEL"}}},{"id":"FfEGrxHMvW","date":"2020-01-25T10:43:45.684Z","rating":3,"title":"1 - 4\n90 m...","description":"1 - 4\n90 min","user":{"username":"jphyde9","id":"ER1VS6ReGW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"RvQRrz0gEL"}}},{"id":"qac9lMuaDQ","date":"2020-01-25T07:35:33.180Z","rating":4,"title":"After a 3 ...","description":"After a 3 player game - Nice game.
