After 2 more plays, upgraded to 8.0. After 5 games, upgraded to 8.5. This game is really good and as a two player game better than it's big brother. Still hesitant to purchase the expansion, which is quite expensive (almost the base game) and as we don't play it that often, there's probably no need for the expansion as the base game is very good as it is.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"j8LdPFmePE"}}},{"id":"M18xbiocku","date":"2020-03-09T15:00:49.099Z","rating":4,"title":"Great 2 pl...","description":"Great 2 player game, a little randomness, but strong back and forth counter-play that gets better the more plays with the same person","user":{"username":"bwoller","id":"UtOazeQEfx"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"j8LdPFmePE"}}},{"id":"0Qjd3zoG40","date":"2020-03-04T19:33:19.864Z","rating":3,"title":"This is a ...","description":"This is a good game that feels like a distant relative to 7 Wonders.The semi hidden draft mechanic works really well.","user":{"username":"antiussentiment","id":"jqE5Gn3RFW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"j8LdPFmePE"}}},{"id":"SMrBG4ZhbM","date":"2020-02-28T22:50:55.205Z","rating":4,"title":"My wife li...","description":"My wife likes to play, so it gets extra points.

I love that it gives me the feeling of 7 wonders, but with 2 people.  the idea of having blind card that you don't know what's coming up and what you could potentially flip over for your opponent is awesome.  It's just such a fun game that is great and really makes you think.","user":{"username":"wallawalla4591","id":"8BduD9e5gV"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"j8LdPFmePE"}}},{"id":"ovBQEFoETi","date":"2020-01-28T15:30:40.633Z","rating":3,"title":"Only playe...","description":"Only played once, so will try it again, but the game I played was heavily imbalanced.
