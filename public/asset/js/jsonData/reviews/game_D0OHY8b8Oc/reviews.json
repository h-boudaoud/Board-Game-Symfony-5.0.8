Totally get why it is so popular though and I will hang onto my set for a while I am sure even if it gets limited play. Also the tiles are just so pleasing to hold and move!","user":{"username":"Courageous Bob","id":"vYQtEV9o0A"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"D0OHY8b8Oc"}}},{"id":"0VJ0H9l6cO","date":"2020-04-14T23:26:55.826Z","rating":5,"title":"Bug Chess","description":"Bug Chess is amazing, and bug-like in the best way that crawls into your ear and latches onto your brain and...FOR THE HIVE.\n\nThe way the pieces build off of each other to form the board is both cool and central to the mechanics.  Takes a moment to learn how the pieces move, but the combo of color and bug-personality somehow makes them easy to remember!  Plays fast but intensely strategic.","user":{"username":"Wyrd","id":"SYE77fvfyX"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"D0OHY8b8Oc"}}},{"id":"OwXI6SUvZ3","date":"2020-04-14T20:19:22.269Z","rating":4,"title":"I've never...","description":"I've never won a game of this, but I really do enjoy it.
