Essentially it boils down to what can you do with what you have. I prefer to play coop style (one of the few games I like as a coop) and just do your best to defeat the game together. A little complicated and thus does not get played a lot.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"exdy1Z2bSC"}}}]
