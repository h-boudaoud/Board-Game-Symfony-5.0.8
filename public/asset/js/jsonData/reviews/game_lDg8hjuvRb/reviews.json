Although each of those features is very simplified, the combination makes for a fairly complex game that favors long-term planning.\n\nThe game has a few too many mechanics for my taste and your whole plan can go to waste if you build your strategy around scoring tiles that do not show up or don't manage to win during the bidding phase. Sure that may be considered as poor play, but sometimes it just looks like a player got lucky and managed to grab a tile that gave them a bunch of very cheap points. As happens with many multiplayer games, not all players are willing to sacrifice their position in order to prevent somebody else from getting something very cheap.\n\nI really want to like the game. But I rather play many other games.","user":{"username":"apertotes","id":"7lwtCGdS6p"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"lDg8hjuvRb"}}},{"id":"rFEs78wWvO","date":"2019-10-18T17:04:13.006Z","rating":4,"title":"One of the...","description":"One of the best multiplayer game which everyone engage, very pleasant first play","user":{"username":"bunoc","id":"sF2VOVsH64"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"lDg8hjuvRb"}}},{"id":"oRffnUNenE","date":"2019-10-17T17:53:09.328Z","rating":2,"title":"Not good f...","description":"Not good for two players.
