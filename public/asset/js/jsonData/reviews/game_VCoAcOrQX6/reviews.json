I thought the setting and premise of the game was interesting, but there's not really any intrigue or meat there for me. In the end, I didn't really enjoy playing it, I was just going through the motions and there wasn't anything challenging or interesting about the game in the end once you get over the initial intrigue.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VCoAcOrQX6"}}},{"id":"I9g8bdGGwv","date":"2020-04-01T02:15:05.244Z","rating":4,"title":"Great game...","description":"Great game for groups of 5+.

I just don't do deceit well apparently. This is probably the best one I've played so far though. There's more going here then just trying to figure out who is lying and who is telling the truth. Fun for me as the forensic scientist or an investigator, less so when I'm the murderer. This is the game I drag out when I have a lot of people that would rather talk than play a complicated boardgame. It always seems to go over well and I'm often surprised how capable of deception some folks are.","user":{"username":"Kbieb","id":"a14hHC8tAx"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VCoAcOrQX6"}}},{"id":"tOmOhd6heK","date":"2020-01-26T18:03:35.011Z","rating":3,"title":"Like new c...","description":"Like new condition, adult own, non smoker","user":{"username":"LoTazLo","id":"dGkHyagFD6"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VCoAcOrQX6"}}},{"id":"EW8yMyDaX3","date":"2020-01-26T03:35:36.356Z","rating":4,"title":"I would de...","description":"I would describe this as The Resistance meets Mysterium.

It's super simple to setup and teach with a great theme. Anyone that has played Clue will instantly understand what's going on. It's always a hit.\n\nI will say that the game lacks a decent structure so we've house ruled how each round works. Also the game in our group is way too easy so we have everyone with a total of 10 clues in front of them instead of 8. Even at 10 we've found that it can still be fairly easy to figure out who the murder is unless the Forensic Scientist is just awful. We may eventually bump it up to 12 per person.\n","user":{"username":"Deucejack","id":"mGrdNHgXEE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VCoAcOrQX6"}}},{"id":"uIPHq3sOc3","date":"2020-01-20T18:05:35.179Z","rating":3,"title":"shipped No...","description":"shipped November 4th - never received so they are shipping again registered 12\/5\/2014  (www.hongkongpost.com)","user":{"username":"javajoe96","id":"TVSY9G5uFc"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VCoAcOrQX6"}}},{"id":"7kOaQxFpRw","date":"2020-01-04T04:32:03.585Z","rating":3,"title":"I received...","description":"I received this game as a Christmas gift, opened it and reviewed the rules in a matter of minutes before playing multiple games with my relatives (many of them non-gamers).
