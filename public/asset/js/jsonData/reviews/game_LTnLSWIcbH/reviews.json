Because 1\/4 of the cards are wager cards, you can end up with a lot of them instead of point cards. Good game if you go into it knowing you could very well end up with negative points.","user":{"username":"MarkPatoka","id":"5FBWZNeRBi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"LTnLSWIcbH"}}},{"id":"U5HhYZsaLH","date":"2020-07-20T14:02:14.791Z","rating":4,"description":"One of my favourite two player games.

Your goals must not be spread out over too many excavations, as there is only a limited amount of cards shared by both players.  Quick game, but drawback is it's only 2-player (well, unless you buy another copy of the game).  One mechanic I like is that you must either play OR discard a card on your turn. Your opponent can then choose to take the card you discarded.  I also like how the game is light, small and easy to set up and plays quickly.","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"LTnLSWIcbH"}}},{"id":"0IVl8zLhsv","date":"2020-04-01T02:51:23.725Z","rating":2,"title":"A fun game...","description":"A fun game, though it's lacking in a little bit of depth.

The rules are very simple and the luck factor is definitely there (as you draw cards and have to play one each turn), but it is certainly a game where some skill is involved. You try to focus on a few colours, as you pay 20 points for every colour you start. However, you don't want to show early on which colours you'll be playing, trying to entice your opponent to throw out the card you need.I'm a fan of Knizia's work and this game is certainly one of my favourites, although Euphrate & Tigris and -to a lesser extent- Genius are also very enjoyable.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"LTnLSWIcbH"}}},{"id":"lL4vIKkpPG","date":"2020-03-09T23:07:30.783Z","rating":3,"title":"Quick, fun...","description":"Quick, fun game, where you're regularly confronted with extremely tough decisions.
