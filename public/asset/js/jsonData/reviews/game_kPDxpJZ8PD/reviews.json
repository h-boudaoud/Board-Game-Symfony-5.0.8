It plays great as a solo game!So I figured I would try the solo game out as a couple years ago I played it as a multiplayer and felt it was too chaotic. Most of the time I didn\u2019t know what that the hell was going on.  And I am not sure the people I learned it from were gifted at teaching games.  But anyways it has been a couple years and I figured I would see if it was as good of a solo game as I had heard. Truly great puzzle.  The manual is crap.  You should check this link out if you want to learn the game, really great work.  https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/thread\/2141334\/teaching-spirit-isl...September 2019$46.74 BoardGameCo","user":{"username":"Wolfbearheart","id":"h5ZExFcIac"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"kPDxpJZ8PD"}}},{"id":"B4jdktqZWE","date":"2020-07-19T15:39:13.748Z","rating":5,"description":"Co-op \/ Solo","user":{"username":"Vucora","id":"Gd7ghgvUUq"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"kPDxpJZ8PD"}}},{"id":"5tQRikuEYq","date":"2020-07-16T12:08:54.652Z","rating":5,"title":"Fabulous brain melting cooperative fun","description":"Just don't play at 4p, when game time falls off a cliff","user":{"username":"lukeorafferty","id":"7Kp9LmCgXm"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"kPDxpJZ8PD"}}}]
