[{"id":"Ibp8Xeov8E","date":"2020-07-03T14:54:17.989Z","rating":5,"title":"A Tight Race Against Time","description":"Marco Polo is one of my favorite Euros for a very strange reason.  Normally I am not a huge fan of super tight restrictions in a game, but for whatever reason, in this game I LOVE IT.  You will never have enough money, camels, or goods to accomplish all you want in a paltry 5 rounds.  Just when the perfect contract comes up, someone places their die there and takes others, now making your perfect contract cost more coins than you have.  Ouch.  \n\nThis push and pull and optimizing your path around the map makes for a delicious struggle.  If this doesn't sound fun, then give the new Marco Polo II a try.  It loosens the reigns so to speak but still retains the great core gameplay.","user":{"username":"LedBretter","id":"wrI6TK3YIO"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jBBIIYQmED"}}},{"id":"jA4JoCqCQb","date":"2020-04-02T01:33:26.070Z","rating":4,"title":"https:\/\/ww...","description":"https:\/\/www.yucata.de\/en\/GameInfo\/MarcoPolo","user":{"username":"derbius","id":"FKop3gaFsM"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jBBIIYQmED"}}},{"id":"UmVyGqtJao","date":"2020-04-01T19:01:01.409Z","rating":4,"title":"My rating ...","description":"My rating comes with the caveat that you use the Luck Reduction & Refined Balance Variant found on the BGG forums.","user":{"username":"Bryle","id":"lLhNFG8GGJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jBBIIYQmED"}}},{"id":"FFKV3YHEBN","date":"2020-03-18T00:41:19.838Z","rating":4,"title":"2-4 player...","description":"2-4 playersRating based on 1st plays, which I really enjoyed.

Easy to learn and play and plenty of variety between plays. Not a ton of strategy or engine building - more just making the best with what you're dealt.
