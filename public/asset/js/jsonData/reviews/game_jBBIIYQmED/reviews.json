Normally I am not a huge fan of super tight restrictions in a game, but for whatever reason, in this game I LOVE IT.  You will never have enough money, camels, or goods to accomplish all you want in a paltry 5 rounds.  Just when the perfect contract comes up, someone places their die there and takes others, now making your perfect contract cost more coins than you have.  Ouch.  \n\nThis push and pull and optimizing your path around the map makes for a delicious struggle.  If this doesn't sound fun, then give the new Marco Polo II a try.  It loosens the reigns so to speak but still retains the great core gameplay.","user":{"username":"LedBretter","id":"wrI6TK3YIO"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jBBIIYQmED"}}},{"id":"jA4JoCqCQb","date":"2020-04-02T01:33:26.070Z","rating":4,"title":"https:\/\/ww...","description":"https:\/\/www.yucata.de\/en\/GameInfo\/MarcoPolo","user":{"username":"derbius","id":"FKop3gaFsM"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jBBIIYQmED"}}},{"id":"UmVyGqtJao","date":"2020-04-01T19:01:01.409Z","rating":4,"title":"My rating ...","description":"My rating comes with the caveat that you use the Luck Reduction & Refined Balance Variant found on the BGG forums.","user":{"username":"Bryle","id":"lLhNFG8GGJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jBBIIYQmED"}}},{"id":"FFKV3YHEBN","date":"2020-03-18T00:41:19.838Z","rating":4,"title":"2-4 player...","description":"2-4 playersRating based on 1st plays, which I really enjoyed.

The game in general is tight, strategic, and full of indirect player interaction like any good Euro game. But the characters each offer a unique strategy through  their incredibly powerful abilities. Without the character tiles, Marco Polo would be quite ordinary, but their inclusion launched the game to stardom. Some characters are highly situational, while others are more generalist in nature, but each presents a new path to journey. Strategies are plentiful and balanced, and despite the presence of dice players are never handcuffed by a poor die roll. The game is very well paced, always seeming to end at its peak. I find myself thinking about this game long after each game session, and am perpetually awaiting my next play.","user":{"username":"ekloff","id":"a8RJxg0qVT"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jBBIIYQmED"}}},{"id":"ILYXvqpTrd","date":"2019-01-10T18:56:24.849Z","rating":3,"title":"Fantastic ...","description":"Fantastic dice roller than reminiscent of Alien Frontiers, but without the \"take that\" mechanic that you can employ.
