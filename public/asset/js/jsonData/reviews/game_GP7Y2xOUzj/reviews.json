Seems so far to have great replayability, it's a simple game, but it lets you try to think out of the box and get on a wavelength with your partner.  So far I'm loving it.  Don't know how it will hold up over time, but it's quickly shot up my play list and I'm always happy to bring it out some more.The only real hinkiness in the rules is the whole part about keeping a straight face, and not giving anything away.  Of course it's essential to play a straight game, but it's hard not to high five your partner if he gets what you were trying to go for on something brilliant.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"GP7Y2xOUzj"}}},{"id":"H8S6PPtRHb","date":"2020-03-24T20:33:41.444Z","rating":3,"title":"A great pa...","description":"A great party game.","user":{"username":"princetonwong","id":"62dn1tmxwO"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"GP7Y2xOUzj"}}},{"id":"MqIgheXyvr","date":"2020-03-18T00:20:29.268Z","rating":3,"title":"Rating bas...","description":"Rating based on 1st plays with 3 players.

We wound up playing about 10 games in a row until people had to start leaving. Everyone had a blast! I've also played it with my game group (it was a friend's copy) and the three of us that didn't own it, ordered it immediately. This game is fun with just about anyone, definitely one of the first I would reach for to play with non-gamers but I also wouldn't hesitate to bring it out with hardcore hobbyists either.","user":{"username":"Kbieb","id":"a14hHC8tAx"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"GP7Y2xOUzj"}}},{"id":"VkhkxSzjFF","date":"2020-01-26T03:25:51.628Z","rating":3,"title":"Fun and in...","description":"Fun and inventive.
