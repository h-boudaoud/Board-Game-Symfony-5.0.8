Expansive for the empire as the fleet grows and the tide of armies stretches across the universe. Tense for the rebel\u2019s as the board gets more and more oppressive.The expansion does improve this game.Ok with 3 or 4 in team play, but probably a better two player game when all things considered. The team play does mean my two sons can play against me. Which holds their interest longer and gives them more confidence.","user":{"username":"NeilGordon","id":"Ahchq6lnef"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"Qq2rPNOpoO"}}}]
