I love the balancing act between buttons (money) and time. The spatial element also greatly appeals to me - my favorite abstract game.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"9iBOPn3lES"}}},{"id":"0KcoKkzEch","date":"2020-07-26T12:22:19.412Z","rating":5,"description":"February 2020$19 Half Price","user":{"username":"Wolfbearheart","id":"h5ZExFcIac"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"9iBOPn3lES"}}},{"id":"tZcPJToDIn","date":"2020-07-20T14:06:17.874Z","rating":4,"description":"I really like the time track, and I do like this game overall.

Great 2 player game. Easy to learn and plays fast. My son is a big fan of this game. We've also bought and tried Cottage Garden, but we strongly prefer this one and have traded away Cottage Garden. The short playing time and the small sized box are ideal for trips\/holidays, so this one will have amply playing time.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"9iBOPn3lES"}}},{"id":"qGG0dvzQ0r","date":"2020-02-26T18:08:30.357Z","rating":4,"title":"Played wit...","description":"Played with my wife (who normally doesn't like complicated games) and had a blast.

Patchwork is so popular because Patchwork is so good. The only thing that would make it better is if it had bears. What's that you say?
