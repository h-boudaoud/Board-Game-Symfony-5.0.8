And yes, while we can weight the bag towards us even more, the fact that we would have to doctor the game beyond the rulebook really deters us from invest anymore into the series. While I hear great things about the expansions, I think I'm going have to shelve this for a bit. Because of the work that goes into the setup of act 2, the difficulty quickly ramping from act to act (easy, hard, insane), and the fact that you don't really \"win\" the game because it's essentially a starter kit, in my opinion, you're better off looking for another game. I personally might try Elder Sign or Arkham Horror (third edition), but until I do, I don't have a recommendation.","user":{"username":"Truzen","id":"gY6w53ZSn9"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"4G32qGJZWs"}}},{"id":"pAMuQR3UF0","date":"2020-01-26T12:34:16.231Z","rating":4,"title":"Played it ...","description":"Played it only as solitaire and i think id enjoy it more two player.","user":{"username":"MAdderMAnn","id":"y8cP8sA2Sp"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"4G32qGJZWs"}}},{"id":"wDqQvdoR0T","date":"2020-01-26T03:18:36.111Z","rating":2,"title":"Nope, that...","description":"Nope, that's it, I'm done.

I don't care much for the boardgame or much anything else. But I love the constructed deck style of this LCG and how, like LotR before it, it plays along a storyline and that it's a great co-op. It's the only LCG I maintain in my collection.\n\nEven though they're different kinds of games, this has replaced T.I.M.E. Stories for me. While the stories the modules are built upon are rather thin, there's enough content to make it replayable infinitely. As opposed to T.I.M.E.
