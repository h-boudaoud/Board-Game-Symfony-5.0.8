It would be nice to play this a couple of times in quick succession to really cement the rules.Probably a bit tricky for children, due to the confusing role selection mechanic and strategies for engine building.","user":{"username":"andybeta","id":"iBINPaJZ01"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"1sQP1kNHja"}}},{"id":"epGTVKgchV","date":"2020-04-01T19:00:35.594Z","rating":3,"title":"Chopping B...","description":"Chopping Block","user":{"username":"Bryle","id":"lLhNFG8GGJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"1sQP1kNHja"}}},{"id":"f1ZXlQiepP","date":"2020-04-01T02:53:08.213Z","rating":2,"title":"I'm basica...","description":"I'm basically done with Race for the Galaxy, but I could be entertained by Roll for the Galaxy another time or two.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"1sQP1kNHja"}}},{"id":"GAABswYgjL","date":"2020-03-18T00:43:23.800Z","rating":4,"title":"2-5 player...","description":"2-5 players, c. 45 minutes, tableau buildingHave played almost a dozen games and I really like this game quite a bit.

It's... weird. I'd probably find it less weird if I haven't played Race 100+ times, but it'd still be weird.

I am a bit concerned that shipping is necessary for victory, but I am ready to declare that the game is solidly good.\nIt's definitely less open that Race, though--a strong dice-cycling system is a must.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"1sQP1kNHja"}}},{"id":"ANDVUfRgrp","date":"2020-01-25T07:11:24.008Z","rating":4,"title":"Expansions...","description":"Expansions:\n- Ambition\n- Rivalry\n\nSatisfying dice rolls with dice cups provided in each player colour and an assortment of coloured mini dice as workers.\n\nDoesn't take too long to play, for what it is.
