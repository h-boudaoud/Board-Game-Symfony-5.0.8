I think I would have enjoyed the theme much more during my teen years, although admittedly, any theme could have been tacked onto this one. Had I played this before I played Caylus, then perhaps I would rate it higher. But, it is very difficult to follow in Caylus' footsteps.On the bright side, at least they didn't make it with plastic miniatures. I'll stick with Caylus, thanks.","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"axOr9uuOwN"}}},{"id":"GbaQqGICFO","date":"2020-04-01T02:51:22.140Z","rating":2,"title":"Typical wo...","description":"Typical worker placement with a gimmick in that it's Dungeons and Dragons and you can get people to play it that otherwise might not be interested.Not sure about the balance of all the spots and all, but so far it has been fun to play.Over time, it really gets more meh.  I mean, everyone knows all the spots, and all the games feel pretty much the same.  It gets very repetitive very fast.

The game is a great introduction to worker placement for new and casual gamers.  I find that it builds very well off of Ticket to Ride: the concept of the route tickets in TTR translates quite easily to the quests in LoW.This is a good game to have in my collection in that it fills that casual couples gaming niche.  I won't be pulling it out with veteran gamer groups, but it's a good one to have in reserve for a more casual night of gaming because it allows conversation and socializing while providing a fun, light game experience.","user":{"username":"permagoof","id":"EE9k3rx1UU"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"axOr9uuOwN"}}},{"id":"LZJj90FoUI","date":"2020-02-28T01:36:19.893Z","rating":4,"title":"One of the...","description":"One of the most talked about entry level worker placement games for a reason!

It is to Caylus what the D&D adventure co-ops are to Descent. That may not sound like much of a compliment to many, but I really like worker-placement, and I think that the D&D co-ops are a wonderful distillation of what is best in the genre. This isn't as good as the top-tier worker-placement games (for me, Age of Empires and Tribune), though.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"axOr9uuOwN"}}},{"id":"rBmYsLta86","date":"2020-01-25T10:45:56.171Z","rating":3,"title":"Players 2-...","description":"Players 2-5\nTime 60 min.","user":{"username":"jphyde9","id":"ER1VS6ReGW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"axOr9uuOwN"}}}]
