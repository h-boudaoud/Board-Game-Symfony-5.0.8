In the end, I find out really kind of boring, and there isn't much in it that I would want to play it anymore.  I would play it if group decision dictated, but only because it's so fast, that it would be done quick.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"1dWE5BIcOm"}}},{"id":"sdguZJIUJF","date":"2020-03-18T00:43:44.448Z","rating":3,"title":"Rating bas...","description":"Rating based on 1st games, both live and on the app. Will proabably not be played much, so willing to trade this away and stick to the app instead.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"1dWE5BIcOm"}}},{"id":"sNzwnvVbIw","date":"2020-03-01T19:25:54.067Z","rating":4,"title":"Fills the ...","description":"Fills the 2-player slot for me in a very nice way.

A 6 may be a bit generous for this title. Very little theme. Artwork is good and likely the best part about the game. It doesn't feel like playing a Sci-Fi game at all. Just a number cruncher, card optimization and luck of the draw. There are plenty of other games I would prefer to play over this. After thinking about it more, a 6 is probably much too generous.
