I played hours of chess growing up, and that was the main board game that I played for years.  The biggest issue I had with chess was that the strategy was super heavy and the game went super long for what it is.  When I first played Onitama, it gave me the feeling of chess in a much FASTER and, less brain burning way.  I enjoy the simplicity of Onitama so much and it is a fantastic game that is elegant.  I love that the strategy is not just what your move is but, also what moves you give for your opponent to do.  Fantastic game!","user":{"username":"wallawalla4591","id":"8BduD9e5gV"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}},{"id":"awnfYoRyIH","date":"2020-01-30T18:54:50.027Z","rating":4,"title":"Plus:\n- Se...","description":"Plus:\n- Sensei's Path (Want)\n- Way of the Wind (Want)","user":{"username":"Buck817","id":"Py45SQtZVs"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}},{"id":"BDzF5lLLC4","date":"2020-01-26T00:11:19.809Z","rating":3,"title":"2","description":"2","user":{"username":"TalksToChalk","id":"ttBznVfupr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}},{"id":"MJd4pvKltp","date":"2020-01-25T05:58:42.877Z","rating":3,"title":"[b][size=1...","description":"[b][size=12][BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0]Sleeved[\/BGCOLOR][\/size][\/b]\n","user":{"username":"kentdavies","id":"LiAt0DjAeB"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}},{"id":"PAbYssd6Re","date":"2020-01-24T22:09:18.483Z","rating":3,"title":"2015 Engli...","description":"2015 English Edition\n\nExpected Release: TBA","user":{"username":"stylemys","id":"fxATW4CAQ5"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}},{"id":"MUH9bZeBEj","date":"2019-12-20T14:32:33.925Z","rating":5,"title":"Sleeved.","description":"Sleeved.","user":{"username":"El_Enemigo","id":"VTNMZgfOCQ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}},{"id":"sBUTM3fSlq","date":"2019-12-03T19:35:24.768Z","rating":3,"title":"A very str...","description":"A very strategic two player game similar to chess. Each of the pieces move based on the cards that you are holding with an extra card set to the side of the board. Once you select the movement that you want to do and move your piece, you swap the card you picked for the card that is set aside. The way the cards rotate back and forth require you to think ahead and be very flexible in your strategy. I strongly recommend.","user":{"username":"rarroyo","id":"76P6FtbgDC"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}},{"id":"e7DeOTE8un","date":"2019-11-03T01:17:46.786Z","rating":3,"title":"App","description":"App","user":{"username":"Level 1","id":"0VDKQ7Ao5W"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"qYpZFGkKyD"}}}]
