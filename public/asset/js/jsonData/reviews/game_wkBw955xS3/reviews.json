While there are lots of minor rules, the strategies are quite clear. The modular building-laying mechanism, immediate rewards etc. The first game that I would want to drill on the combos.","user":{"username":"princetonwong","id":"62dn1tmxwO"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"wkBw955xS3"}}},{"id":"8UEgR3uBgq","date":"2020-03-18T00:40:52.769Z","rating":4,"title":"Alexander ...","description":"Alexander Pfister's best rated game.
