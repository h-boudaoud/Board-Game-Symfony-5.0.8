There are multiple paths to victory, but they're much more well defined. Also, the movement, deck-building, and engine-building aspects of it are all quite dissimilar to Brass.It's nothing short of excellent, and I'm so pleased to have it in my collection! Only played it twice so far, and I think I'll play it a bunch vanilla before I even think about the expansion.","user":{"username":"Perchy","id":"XyM3iXdu83"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"wkBw955xS3"}}},{"id":"qhIHcfer3l","date":"2020-07-26T12:19:02.810Z","rating":5,"description":"April 2020-I can see liking this one for a long time.  Every strategy seems to work out pretty well.  Of course, you don\u2019t know going into the game what all you will have, so you can\u2019t go into the game knowing your strategy.  The decision points are usually pretty straightforward.  Though very complex it doesn\u2019t feel brain burning.
