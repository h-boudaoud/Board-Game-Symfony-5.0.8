I played it with friends, and I watched them play a lot. The one who starts the game from the first level cards, against the one who bid the cards at the higher level. The second one is going to win with 3 or 4 cards in the end, no noble, but the second one can have a noble but who cares?","user":{"username":"fzerorubigd","id":"2WmvkhpCwW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"O0G8z5Wgz1"}}},{"id":"AEtSHviH8I","date":"2020-05-03T15:05:04.130Z","rating":4,"title":"I haven't ...","description":"I haven't played any of the \"better\" games to have supposedly replaced Splendor.

It\u2019s the right level of accessibility and devious planning and smooth turns to keep my wife giddy with the desire for shiny gems and my defeat.  Plays great with young kids too, no reading just a few numbers needed...maybe with their help one of us will be able to defeat my wife someday!","user":{"username":"Wyrd","id":"SYE77fvfyX"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"O0G8z5Wgz1"}}},{"id":"OOIrwiMCXH","date":"2020-04-01T18:31:51.077Z","rating":2,"title":"Take gems,...","description":"Take gems, spend gems on cards. Cards provide discount on other cards and some are worth points. Players accumulate both gems and cards to collect enough cards to equal or exceed 15 points. First to 15 wins.It's a decent game, but nothing too exciting. I think it gets favorable ratings due to it being new. Cult of the New and all.","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"O0G8z5Wgz1"}}},{"id":"gV9j4NK8wH","date":"2020-04-01T02:53:29.505Z","rating":2,"title":"Very light...","description":"Very light, fairly quick game.  Not much in the way of design.  There's not a whole lot going on.  But this card to buy that card to build your engine to buy future cards.There's a small amount of hosage with one of the actions.  But the game is pretty dry. At least it's fast.  I'll probably play it a time or two, but really there's not much here.  I only bought it cuz it was cheap and had good reviews as a gateway.  I guess I just don't like gateways.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"O0G8z5Wgz1"}}}]
