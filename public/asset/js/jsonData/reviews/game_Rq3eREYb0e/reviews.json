If i had any complaint about it at all, is that long stretches of silence arent exactly the best for a party but it's absolutely worth owning and playing.The best part of this game is that it forces people to play. Quiet friends who worry about making a bad move are pushed into action and become part of the experience. I've played this with people who are normally left out of the fun of gaming because of their anxiety over making the \"wrong\" move, but in this game inaction can be the wrong move, coaxing those people out of their shell, which makes it really brilliant and a must own for families.","user":{"username":"MJay1010","id":"RoZTbOrGyk"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"Rq3eREYb0e"}}},{"id":"GqItuRMs2i","date":"2020-04-04T15:16:04.732Z","rating":3,"title":"I understand why its a love it or hate it game.","description":"im reluctant to call this a \"GAME\" that being said its really fun . This game can be brutally difficult to play but when you actually complete a couple of rounds the feeling of satisfaction is WONDERFUL . Its not for every group but it def has its place at my table .
