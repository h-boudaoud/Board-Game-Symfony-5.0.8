If i had any complaint about it at all, is that long stretches of silence arent exactly the best for a party but it's absolutely worth owning and playing.The best part of this game is that it forces people to play. Quiet friends who worry about making a bad move are pushed into action and become part of the experience. I've played this with people who are normally left out of the fun of gaming because of their anxiety over making the \"wrong\" move, but in this game inaction can be the wrong move, coaxing those people out of their shell, which makes it really brilliant and a must own for families.","user":{"username":"MJay1010","id":"RoZTbOrGyk"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"Rq3eREYb0e"}}}]
