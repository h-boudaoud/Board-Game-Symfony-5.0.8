It's fine.  But it's an unforgiving game. Sometimes a player can be out of the game after some rounds.

It requires more math than one would think would be necessary for a fun game, but a fun game it is indeed, and I really enjoy playing it. In about 2 hours or less, you build a network that you power with your resources, and you're trying to balance the cost of expanding that network with being able to power it . . . it's a constant balance that keeps you engaged the entire time. Player interaction isn't so much \"take that\" as it is \"well, you took the one I wanted, so now I have to reevaluate things\", and it seems to be the right amount of interaction for this game.","user":{"username":"BackBurnerGames","id":"bLRwfwEKuF"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"Meszt3IFfX"}}},{"id":"F7hfUCEvD0","date":"2020-03-03T23:04:16.978Z","rating":3,"title":"Make you t...","description":"Make you think, in a good way.
