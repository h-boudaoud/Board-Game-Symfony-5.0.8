An intense spatial abstract wrapped in a presentation so delightful that you can con your children into learning it and then regret that immensely years later when you can no longer beat them.  Power cards add lots of fun ways to spice up the base game or handicap\/balance players of different ability.  Having the two pawns to move\/build allows for all sorts of fascinating strategies and traps.  This one will be around a long long time.","user":{"username":"Wyrd","id":"SYE77fvfyX"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VibNUMwsqr"}}},{"id":"KgnHE4EyHl","date":"2020-04-01T02:53:11.212Z","rating":3,"title":"This game ...","description":"This game is really great, easy to teach, quick to play, and has depth to it with its strategy.

Have played a couply of games now with the basic gods and this is indeed a lot of fun. Unfortunately we don't play that many abstracts, but this one would be my go to choice.Haven't tried the 3p version or the Golden Fleece expansion yet, will probably trade away the expansion, as I don't need it.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"VibNUMwsqr"}}}]
