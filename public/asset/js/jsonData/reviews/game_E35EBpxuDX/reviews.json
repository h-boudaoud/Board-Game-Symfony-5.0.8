Easy to teach, everyone grasps it right away and gets into building their engine.  While I personally prefer the look and components of the Golem edition, the theme there tends to turn off casuals while Spice Road is more appealing.","user":{"username":"permagoof","id":"EE9k3rx1UU"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E35EBpxuDX"}}},{"id":"li262uFVty","date":"2020-01-26T03:23:04.470Z","rating":2,"title":"You turn c...","description":"You turn cubes into cubes into cubes into cubes...","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E35EBpxuDX"}}},{"id":"x4dsaaFn5Y","date":"2020-01-25T10:32:59.180Z","rating":3,"title":"The theme ...","description":"The theme can completely be taken out of this one as it is really just a pure engine building\/resource management race. You just get cubes to get more cubes to turn into other cubes so that you can score points. It's so simple and yet I just can't get enough of it! I like heavier games for sure but this game is just pure fun to me and it's actually a game my kids can play too!","user":{"username":"Deucejack","id":"mGrdNHgXEE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E35EBpxuDX"}}},{"id":"LFl7YPiHop","date":"2020-01-25T07:11:00.322Z","rating":4,"title":"Use your c...","description":"Use your cards to trade spices and claim victory points. Game runs pretty quickly and scales nicely regardless of how many players you play with. Like most other similar games where there's a communal card\/resource area, I prefer to play with 2 players.","user":{"username":"GossamerSolid","id":"IwHp4RNkLJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E35EBpxuDX"}}},{"id":"YG1Wfxhk4a","date":"2020-01-25T05:54:29.506Z","rating":4,"title":"[b][size=1...","description":"[b][size=12][BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0]Sleeved[\/BGCOLOR][\/size][\/b]\n","user":{"username":"kentdavies","id":"LiAt0DjAeB"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E35EBpxuDX"}}},{"id":"UsQXqBTzev","date":"2020-01-25T00:22:36.953Z","rating":2,"title":"Interestin...","description":"Interesting and light. In general, I think I like Splendor more (which is very similar).

My play was very very quiet though. The game was quick and easy to learn. Quick to play. Many times people were waiting for someone to take their turn but it was their turn already and they had no idea.\n\nI need to play this a few more times to figure my opinion out better. I don't think it is trending in a positive direction over all though.","user":{"username":"NickWatt","id":"zWX4hkk2AE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E35EBpxuDX"}}}]
