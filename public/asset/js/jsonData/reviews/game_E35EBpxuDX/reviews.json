It is not even a very entertaining engine builder because all you get is is more resource\/action efficiency, not actual resources.

It will take 7 plays and 3 resets. Is that a good number of turns? Can my opponent claim the card in less than 10 turns? Will the cards in the market speed that up?

Abstract and quick and a neat little puzzle.\n\nSince the score cards and the action cards in Century: Spice Road are separate, there is a much more tactical nature to this game than there is to Splendor. You really can't plan too far ahead, you can just kind of try to prepare for what cards [i]might[\/i] come out.\n\nNormally I don't use \"tactical\" negatively. Generally a tactical game implies that there is a constantly-changing game state that requires a shift of direction, and some of my very favorite games are quite tactical (Indonesia, El Grande, Chicago Express, Imperial), but in an abstract engine-builder without any player interaction, it's a detriment. \n\nThe prospect of a modular game system that can offer 7 different games is a neat little marketing gimmick, but for $120, I'd rather buy a single game with some teeth rather than a series of rinky-dink games that you probably won't really combine all that often.","user":{"username":"Brent","id":"MQlPznxyCZ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E35EBpxuDX"}}}]
