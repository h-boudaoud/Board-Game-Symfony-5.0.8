Yes, it has lots of random luck because of dice chucking, some of the cards aren't super clear, and there is player elimination. BUT I'm willing to take that because its fun and plays quick. There is still enough strategy to scratch the itch and it doesn't overstay its welcome and you get to be a big monster who is whacking other monsters.","user":{"username":"SonofLars","id":"hIPmS6Krov"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"Y2WacykMm5"}}},{"id":"1hBt9IVLnq","date":"2020-04-15T01:46:09.630Z","rating":3,"title":"","description":"Good fun with the kids, it\u2019s a more exciting kind of Yahtzee.  Have to make sure they don\u2019t get mad at each other for ganging up on each other, but it\u2019s a good lesson.","user":{"username":"Wyrd","id":"SYE77fvfyX"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"Y2WacykMm5"}}},{"id":"5B3tlo7GFG","date":"2020-04-14T20:19:48.686Z","rating":2,"title":"Fun dice r...","description":"Fun dice roller that takes King of the Hill and Yahtzee and some how makes a coherent game.
