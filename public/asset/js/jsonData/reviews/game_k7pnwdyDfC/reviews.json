Best if everyone is on the same ability level because this game is 'highly' dependent upon what happens to the right and left of you.  Takes a long time to set up and clean up as well.  I'd usually rather play something else these days.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k7pnwdyDfC"}}},{"id":"j30PkJIGgx","date":"2020-03-18T01:49:02.665Z","rating":3,"title":"Weight: 3....","description":"Weight: 3.29 \/ 5","user":{"username":"OdysseusX","id":"P0X8HlAGpi"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k7pnwdyDfC"}}},{"id":"bP4f8QEB49","date":"2020-03-18T00:43:08.104Z","rating":4,"title":"Designer: ...","description":"Designer: Andreas SeyfarthArtist: Harald Lieske, Franz VohwinkelPublisher: Alea \/ RavensburgerPlayer count: 2-5 (best with 4)Weight: medium Mechanics: role selection \/ city building \/ economic Setting: players are colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildingsTheme: fairPlay time: 90-120 minutesHaving played numerous games, both offline and online, I can fairly say that this is my favourite game. Despite its age, I haven't come across more recent games that rival this one. This is a strategic game, there is no luck involved, but the rules are fairly easy once you understand the game mechanism. There are several routes to success and usually it stays exciting to the end who will win the game. For non-gamers this one can be quite difficult at first, but after one or two games people know the mechanism and the various roles and buildings and what they do. The games works quite well with 2, 3, 4 or 5 players, which I consider a bonus as not many games do. I'm a fan and want to play this again anytime!I'm hoping to get my hands on the limited edition at a decent price and otherwise consider replacing this one by the reprint, which also includes both expansions.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k7pnwdyDfC"}}},{"id":"0VhO99RNya","date":"2020-03-09T23:10:49.404Z","rating":3,"title":"A bit \"dry...","description":"A bit \"dry\" but still a deep game with lots of strategies to explore.
