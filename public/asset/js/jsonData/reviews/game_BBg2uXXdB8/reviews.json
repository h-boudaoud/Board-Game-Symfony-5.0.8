Hated my first 3 plays of it, but kept getting talked into playing and now see it as a nice lightweight game to play with those not into the heavier side of gaming. Also, there is more here than meets the eye, especially with the different variants.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"BBg2uXXdB8"}}},{"id":"HYtIHHilPf","date":"2020-05-03T22:42:31.792Z","rating":4,"title":"Fast, Fun,...","description":"Fast, Fun, and easy to teach.
