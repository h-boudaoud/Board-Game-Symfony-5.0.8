The only issue I have with the components is the player boards, as you really do need an overlay - otherwise you have to worry about bumping the table just a smidge and you are all messed up. That aside this is a sold engine building game, the theme comes through surprisingly well. I have played mostly as a solitare game and it is very good at that. The multiplayer game has some mean aspects to it that I am not sure I love, but time will tell.*11.28.2018 - Decided I would rarely like this as a multiplayer game, but it is amazing as a solo experience.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"fDn9rQjH9O"}}},{"id":"CkJZJP2nPH","date":"2020-07-20T14:05:20.303Z","rating":5,"description":"I\u2019m sure many others have said enough about this game.

After the initial headache of learning to play, and warning players around the table to be careful to not knock the boards, we all wound up having an absolutely wonderful evening. PHENOMENAL game well worthy of #4 on the overall list, but the cost may be a barrier to entry for many folks, especially given how shit the components are.

And there might be too many cards for that kind of thing anyway, as you would not breed much familiarity with the deck since I believe all the cards are unique and it's like 200 long.

There is ONE thing that threw me off when I opened the box: the graphic design is very amateur. Being a graphic designer myself I always get excited when I see pieces like Mechs VS Minions, Tiny Epic Quest and others with a thought out, well planned graphic design. Typography in this whole set is horrible. The cards are barely readable, color contrast is poorly chosen and they were made to value the photograph that is portrayed in them. This could have been done so much better.","user":{"username":"guzforster","id":"BXzlhlqwCb"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"fDn9rQjH9O"}}},{"id":"vRAmt9donj","date":"2020-03-18T00:43:56.234Z","rating":5,"title":"1-5 player...","description":"1-5 players, best with 3-4, can also be played solo. Medium heavy euro. Really like the theme and the mechanics, and decided to add it to the collection in a trade. While playing, it doesn't feel very thematic though, as the cards usually aren't read thoroughly (it's more about the symbols on the cards). However, with some effort the theme certainly: just read the cars, most of them are well thought through and make perfect sense from a thematic perspective and do add to the story line.Next to a couple of multiplayer games (with 2 and 3 players), I've also played a number of solo games. It can be quite challenging to meet all the hurdles before time runs out. So far, scores have been all over the place. But I like that, your decisions (and -to some extent- luck of the draw) do impact your game quite a bit, but usually, the better player does win the game, as building your engine successfully is a major part of the (winning) strategy. So far VERY happy with this addition. Have also played this with my son and he REALLY likes it.Cannot recommend this enough. What a great game! Definite keeper in my collection and in my top 10.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"fDn9rQjH9O"}}},{"id":"Kxch59DaQS","date":"2020-03-07T03:12:39.063Z","rating":5,"title":"1-5","description":"1-5","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"fDn9rQjH9O"}}},{"id":"sbdN3o77LS","date":"2020-03-05T15:09:07.696Z","rating":4,"title":"I've only ...","description":"I've only played this once at 4 players. A little slow to get going because 1) we were all new 2) you have to build the engine, but I think we all \"got it\" by midgame and by the end I had a nice little engine running.

All the whiners about the components or people that claim to knock the cubes around \"multiple times per game\"?  Ignore them.  Components are fine.  Card artwork is great for me.  Learn how to control where your hands and elbows are.  Enjoy the game immensely every time I play, win or lose. I will play with or without drafting.  Once you know the various paths and strategies, I do not see drafting adding gobs of time unless you have an AP animal playing.

But it feels like I am learning the game for the first time every time I play it. Yeah I get the basics. But I guess I don't play it enough to feel like I am gaining a grasp on the game in general. Or maybe the boring nature of the theme, or as I like to say, \"the lack of theme\" disinterests me. Yeah you are supposed to be of course terraforming mars. But it does not feel like that at all for me, despite all of the cool components, art, and board. Every time I play it just feels like a card game, with too much text, and takes way too GD long!! Seriously, can anyone even name one card that they have in their tableau when done?? Maybe the uber fans that have played it 50+ times? I don't know, I would rather play something interesting during those 5+ hours.\n\nIt is a good game for those it is targeting. Obviously it has a following. I will\/would give it another chance maybe, if in the mood.
