Draft buildings and critters to play onto your tableau. Different sets can earn you goals worth VPs. Cards are also worth points. Worker placement mechanic in order to do any action other than playing a card from your hand. Some cards make other cards free (i.e. the Farm allows for the free play of a Man\/Woman critter); otherwise, all cards have a resource cost.","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8xos44jY7Q"}}},{"id":"6mLOpldeYQ","date":"2020-04-01T02:16:00.771Z","rating":2,"title":"This game ...","description":"This game is junk - it is all visual.  The game has so many weird design choices - like why put the goal cards on the tree when they are so small no one card read them?  I played one four player game and felt that I saw everything the game had to offer.Very disappointed with this one.","user":{"username":"TroyNyne","id":"FEjzD24EeL"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8xos44jY7Q"}}},{"id":"tOh1UNGi74","date":"2020-03-24T18:54:54.583Z","rating":4,"title":"Amazing an...","description":"Amazing and beautiful worker placement, resource management and card game.
