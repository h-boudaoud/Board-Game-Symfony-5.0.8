My one complaint is the rule book is a little too \"JOKEY\" and hard to follow.

Certainly a different \"style\" of game than what I'm used to. Will take more plays to see it's staying power, but the first game was fun.Update: I've played the iPad app which is incredibly well done. I enjoy it in that format especially playing with my son. I think this makes a good family game.","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"A38ipJ48QE"}}},{"id":"LFt0pxYFML","date":"2020-04-01T02:49:11.554Z","rating":4,"title":"Alright, I...","description":"Alright, I know this game is kind of Random, and it's goofy, and it's not exactly short, or groundbreaking or anything.But it is freaking fun.
