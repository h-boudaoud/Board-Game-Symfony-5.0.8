Its competitive, full of meaningful decisions that you have to make, fun and clever.I have played Ascension before this and my faith in deckbuilding games weren't too strong. Dominion restored that faith The ability to play a little different every time with different Kingdon card piles is amazing. I'm definitely buffing up my game with more expansions.","user":{"username":"guzforster","id":"BXzlhlqwCb"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"6VQXkkC5ql"}}},{"id":"So2NglTGfa","date":"2020-02-28T01:35:50.389Z","rating":4,"title":"The standa...","description":"The standard in Deck building.

And after a few-month break, it has again become our go-to option to start any game night.\n\nI don't like games of chance; I want to win by out-strategizing my opponents. Dominion shines as a game about _mitigating_ chance. Yes, you still have to rely on the luck of the draw for any given hand, but it's up to you to build a deck with increasingly favorable drawing odds.","user":{"username":"enjayem","id":"HH9pg0LUFY"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"6VQXkkC5ql"}}},{"id":"BPzHGKvB1q","date":"2019-12-02T15:31:57.902Z","rating":5,"title":"Very solid","description":"I have over 200 plays of base games dominion, mostly two person.

As expected, they do elevate this game quite a bit. How to rate this game, though? I'll bump it up to a 7, from 5, but the expansions really are needed to make this game shine.
