The trick to both build your tableau but also keep sufficient cards on hand, als only the tree types of which you have the majority in your hand will actually score points in your tableau. Clever mechanism, would like to play again.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YYQ8Q3dGv"}}}]
