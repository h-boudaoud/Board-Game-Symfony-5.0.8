The draw two\/play one\/discard one action keeps the game moving ahead consistently. It's easy to teach and relatively easy to learn, but mastery is difficult since other players can have such an effect on what cards are available on the table. Players must balance getting cards out onto the table vs keeping their strategy hidden, while also deciding whether to sacrifice precious space in their 7-card hand for holding onto cards to score a type of tree at the end of the game AND\/OR keep another player from scoring.\n\nWe've played this many many times in our household, and it's always a winner.","user":{"username":"lorojoro","id":"CrimsRv3ks"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YYQ8Q3dGv"}}},{"id":"LY3P3glm1k","date":"2020-01-03T22:31:45.992Z","rating":3,"title":"Nine scori...","description":"Nine scoring categories, only the person with the most valuable tree(s) of a type gets to score those trees.
