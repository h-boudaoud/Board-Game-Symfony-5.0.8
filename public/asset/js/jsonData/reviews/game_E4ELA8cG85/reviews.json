What's not to like?The first few plays were frustrating, as I was learning the game and all its iconography. It's not as much fun when you feel rushed by those who choose their roles in two seconds every turn. Much more fun when some thought is put into it, and a few minutes are spent at the end reflecting on your galactic civilization. I have to give mention to the excellent artwork on every single card in this game. Very impressed!","user":{"username":"Desiderata","id":"cClEsRiglP"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"E4ELA8cG85"}}},{"id":"KpuhbvwHb5","date":"2020-03-18T00:43:12.425Z","rating":4,"title":"2-4 player...","description":"2-4 players, 30-45 minutes, medium heavy, deck buildingI love this game, especially with two players this is a fast deck building race game. No game is the same with different starting planets and so many cards that come along during the game.
