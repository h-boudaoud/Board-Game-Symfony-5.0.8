Theme is marvelous and well-integrated into the game, and the game is a blast. \nThe game is not without problems, though. 1) It is imbalanced (heavily in favour of the Soviets); 2) There is a large experience factor in the game (know the deck and prosper); 3) It's really quite random.

I still feel a bit reluctant to play it because it seems daunting but it helps that I learned it at the same time as Chris. Strange that I should feel this way because, other than a few minor points regarding realignments and coups, the rules are not that complex. \n\nI don't know if it's fair or not but I tend to compare TS to Cuba Libre (and by extension the other COIN games I have yet to play) and I feel that TS is the superior game. There is still a fair bit of luck with dice rolling and some devastating cards that can, if they end up in your hand, completely wipe out an opponent's influence\/control of a country. However, you know that your opponent is on an equally luck-based footing so it doesn't seem too awful. And if you end up with a card whose event is bad for you, at least you can dictate when it pops, space it, or simply hold it for the game.\n\nI need to own this one!","user":{"username":"gidorah","id":"asfNJJc1Lr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"nRGa6zZTQu"}}},{"id":"lZKCVXHFpo","date":"2019-10-18T17:04:41.742Z","rating":5,"title":"My all-tim...","description":"My all-time favourite.
