Will quite probably rise to another 10 if I get some more games under my belt.* So it went to 10 and then came back down again. The gameplay is superb, tension is good. Everything seems to be there, but somehow I don't want to play it. No idea why is that.","user":{"username":"paka","id":"rp47DWzo8q"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"nRGa6zZTQu"}}},{"id":"Phs54k2RAy","date":"2020-02-26T06:59:07.945Z","rating":1,"title":"No Review Title","description":"No Review Description","user":{"username":"Zoron","id":"ZuDdury3pW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"nRGa6zZTQu"}}},{"id":"5DSZLM476M","date":"2020-01-26T12:39:40.882Z","rating":4,"title":"The large ...","description":"The large hand of cards feels combersome as a newbie.

Theme is marvelous and well-integrated into the game, and the game is a blast. \nThe game is not without problems, though. 1) It is imbalanced (heavily in favour of the Soviets); 2) There is a large experience factor in the game (know the deck and prosper); 3) It's really quite random. All of that having been said, TS is still brilliant.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"nRGa6zZTQu"}}},{"id":"q2OzFb7sqX","date":"2020-01-26T00:11:35.761Z","rating":4,"title":"2","description":"2","user":{"username":"TalksToChalk","id":"ttBznVfupr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"nRGa6zZTQu"}}},{"id":"ueovnjRI41","date":"2020-01-25T17:08:25.149Z","rating":4,"title":"3","description":"3","user":{"username":"Kamfer","id":"NCXK2RnuIv"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"nRGa6zZTQu"}}},{"id":"8DFW3PF8Ag","date":"2020-01-25T03:09:43.312Z","rating":4,"title":"3","description":"3","user":{"username":"Arcshot","id":"Xpnrl5RFHA"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"nRGa6zZTQu"}}},{"id":"hHN0CsXzdr","date":"2020-01-24T22:34:59.499Z","rating":4,"title":"Awesome ga...","description":"Awesome game.
