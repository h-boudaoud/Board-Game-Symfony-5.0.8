Overwrought player turns and excessive game state upkeep, result in Through the Ages feeling like a dated design despite it's revisions however. The game's unreasonable length and amount of rules will likely doom Through the Ages to the shelf for long stretches of time.","user":{"username":"Bryle","id":"lLhNFG8GGJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k4sSktfbuH"}}},{"id":"Vl2vayzCVq","date":"2020-04-01T02:53:48.605Z","rating":4,"title":"I feel lik...","description":"I feel like everything about this game is better than the original Through the Ages.  Which is amazing, because the Original Through the Ages was absolutely excellent.  I rated it a 9, if this is better, I guess this makes this a 9 too, it might eventually become another 10.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k4sSktfbuH"}}},{"id":"x1g7NOEeHY","date":"2020-03-24T18:56:26.247Z","rating":5,"title":"This game ...","description":"This game is so damn good. So much you can do, so many paths to victory. What a game! There are so many details and rules, but all of them make sense in the game. An excellent brain teaser for strategy.

Once I had played it once, decided to add it to the collection, although it will probably not get much playtime (it's a bit fiddly and very dry and it is a very long game).Fortunately, I also have the app, so can play it solo as well against the AI.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k4sSktfbuH"}}},{"id":"fZUUatLLX1","date":"2020-02-28T09:36:06.175Z","rating":1,"title":"To damn lo...","description":"To damn long for its repetitive and fiddly gameplay loop.

I don't know how much civ games are really my style, but the app is an entertaining solo experience. It's interesting enough that I want to play it more, but not enough that I want to be super competitive. It's the kind of game where being good means memorizing all of the cards, which I'm not a huge fan of. (But there are few enough cards that's reasonable.) I wouldn't mind playing with people, but I'm not going to buy the game.","user":{"username":"warder57","id":"iaobIrOTQm"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k4sSktfbuH"}}},{"id":"cDwnbH3Mix","date":"2020-01-24T22:56:24.343Z","rating":4,"title":"2-4p","description":"2-4p","user":{"username":"saxsoulo","id":"fjfQxfGyjw"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k4sSktfbuH"}}},{"id":"ExpNbeVi3z","date":"2020-01-03T22:58:25.928Z","rating":3,"title":"Game was t...","description":"Game was too long for what it was, if I play again and things are quicker my rating may go up.","user":{"username":"Avron","id":"rZRAVFlqOc"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"k4sSktfbuH"}}},{"id":"3uiC8LJ3ZF","date":"2019-12-20T22:40:31.570Z","rating":5,"title":"11\/15: A b...","description":"11\/15: A beautiful game, and I love the new tactics rule.
