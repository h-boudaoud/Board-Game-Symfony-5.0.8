Never played with 3-p or more though, so I'm excited to get a 4-p game going one day so I can see the other season cards!Went down to 9.5 because of Pax Pamir, which is similar enough but also, I think, a bit better.","user":{"username":"Perchy","id":"XyM3iXdu83"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"ZU41Hyf5p4","date":"2020-07-26T12:22:11.694Z","rating":5,"description":"March 2020Part of BoardGameCo TradeApproximately $55 in trade value","user":{"username":"Wolfbearheart","id":"h5ZExFcIac"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"Hh3l3UJbCX","date":"2020-07-16T12:46:10.411Z","rating":4,"description":"First played in Inis (Ennis), Ireland","user":{"username":"lukeorafferty","id":"7Kp9LmCgXm"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"ECHTpBwhRs","date":"2020-05-15T11:59:26.375Z","rating":5,"title":"An amazing area control game","description":"https:\/\/cardboardguru.com\/2020\/03\/02\/review-inis\/","user":{"username":"Cardboard_Guru","id":"X6edUo7Plm"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"AcnspboYDy","date":"2020-04-01T19:42:27.395Z","rating":5,"title":"This game ...","description":"This game is the perfect blend of theme, art, table presence, and easy to learn, but difficult to master gameplay. As someone who normally plays euros that have little player interaction, it was all the more refreshing when Inis spawned all sorts of table-talk and politicking as we went around trying to talk ourselves into alliances in response to clashses or trying to pacify a player who was trying to invade. This is a wonderful game.","user":{"username":"tylrprtr","id":"DpO6OsMpCQ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"eKmHkffMbq","date":"2020-04-01T02:17:49.757Z","rating":5,"title":"Wow, amazi...","description":"Wow, amazing game.
