As someone who normally plays euros that have little player interaction, it was all the more refreshing when Inis spawned all sorts of table-talk and politicking as we went around trying to talk ourselves into alliances in response to clashses or trying to pacify a player who was trying to invade. This is a wonderful game.","user":{"username":"tylrprtr","id":"DpO6OsMpCQ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"eKmHkffMbq","date":"2020-04-01T02:17:49.757Z","rating":5,"title":"Wow, amazi...","description":"Wow, amazing game.

But I find no appeal to this game at all. I don't like either the art style or the game play.

The more I play it the more I love it. Definitely getting the expansion for the 5th player.\nBeen a hit with everyone I introduced it to.\nWith few rules and the same 13\/17 cards every round, new players pick it up pretty fast. Bonus points for the designer answering on almost every thread here. \n\nThe only gripe I would have are the sometimes unclear timing windows and card interactions and the odd mistranslation which does require reading the forums here for clarification.","user":{"username":"velebni","id":"L1fH0xj1zr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"hLkAWGftfp","date":"2020-01-24T22:07:40.420Z","rating":4,"title":"This game ...","description":"This game keeps getting better each time I play it.","user":{"username":"stylemys","id":"fxATW4CAQ5"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"8fhqhSW1PK","date":"2020-01-02T18:32:15.983Z","rating":4,"title":"JV","description":"JV","user":{"username":"Daggerclaw","id":"0GLdp8HCLL"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"f8S983DCox","date":"2019-10-25T04:10:34.507Z","rating":5,"title":"Not what you think","description":"No matter what idea you have about Inis, you're wrong.

This is mainly due to the \"6\/6\/6\" win conditions.\n-Drafting option of getting rid of the card you just drafted feels like the only natural way to draft cards.\n-Passing but being able to re-enter later rounds makes for some interesting decisions and tense moments.\n\nCONS\n-The \"Check\" aspect of taking the Pretender Token means the game can outstay its welcome. Maybe house rule it so that someone just has to maintain a win and call it at the end of a round?","user":{"username":"gidorah","id":"asfNJJc1Lr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"pPZnlKC4G3"}}},{"id":"rLviPjnVoS","date":"2019-10-18T17:23:37.661Z","rating":3,"title":"A good gam...","description":"A good game.
