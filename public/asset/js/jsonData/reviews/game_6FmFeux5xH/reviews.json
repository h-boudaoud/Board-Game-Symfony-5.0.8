The only reason I can't give it a 10 is because the learning curve to it is kind of steep. It can be a little overwhelming for new players, but once you get over that hump of learning, it just hums along like a smooth engine. You FEEL the tension of outbreaks lurking in hard-to-reach corners of the earth, and the action point selection makes you really consider your choices carefully. I've never had 2 games of Pandemic feel the same, and that leaves me feeling joyful when I consider playing this game.\n\nAnd sweaty. Joyful sweating.","user":{"username":"BackBurnerGames","id":"bLRwfwEKuF"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"6FmFeux5xH"}}},{"id":"E1h9Ab8zJT","date":"2020-02-03T23:24:41.002Z","rating":4,"title":" The tensi...","description":" The tension and co-op makes this game simply sing!\n","user":{"username":"Abysmul","id":"m0lvkCFxfB"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"6FmFeux5xH"}}},{"id":"hzdYAZA0ww","date":"2020-02-02T10:05:47.922Z","rating":4,"title":"One of the...","description":"One of the first games I got and is a great one to have started with.","user":{"username":"Bazooka13","id":"UzHJdjLCjG"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"6FmFeux5xH"}}},{"id":"PmIGXLaxRY","date":"2020-01-31T20:46:23.338Z","rating":5,"title":"Amazing co...","description":"Amazing cooperative game.
