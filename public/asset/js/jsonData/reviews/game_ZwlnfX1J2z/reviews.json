I've owned this game for years, and to the best of my memory I don't think I've ever played a game without referencing the rulebook at least once, if not repeatedly. It takes ages to set up and tear down. It takes several hours to play, so make sure you carve out a big chunk of your day before even trying. And lastly, I highly recommend buying the base game WITH the Forsaken Lore small-box expansion, which fleshes out the base game incredibly well.\n\nPROS: Just about everything else. If you want a big, meaty, hard Eldritch experience, this is an outstanding place to get it. Personally, I'm not much of a long-term planner. I love playing games by the seat of my pants and going with my gut instinct. With that in mind, I have lost this game more often than I've won. But losing has never felt cheap or lame or anticlimactic. It's a struggle from the very outset as the game can be very difficult. It punishes mistakes harshly, and can equally punish inaction. And sometimes it punishes you for no reason at all. But even when the game pushes you right over the edge and the world goes up in flames, you had one hell of a wild ride to get there. And then when you do win, when you sneak in that last game-winning fight before the seams of reality splinter, victory is that much sweeter.","user":{"username":"Crawley","id":"Mx1zTcgHOJ"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"ZwlnfX1J2z"}}},{"id":"0a2pfNy8TX","date":"2020-04-04T15:36:11.555Z","rating":4,"title":"EPIC and BRUTAL","description":"The second \"Modern Board Game\" i ever played .
