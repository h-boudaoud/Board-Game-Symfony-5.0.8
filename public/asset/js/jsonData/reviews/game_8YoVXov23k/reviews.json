It is still a very solid game I would play anytime. The solo game is less desirable.Update: I am liking it the more I play it.","user":{"username":"povertidonki","id":"eqPHRjtz0E"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YoVXov23k"}}},{"id":"VLni8B7Lmt","date":"2020-07-26T11:49:10.500Z","rating":4,"description":"A well rounded Euro. I enjoyed the experience, but I didn't feel like it really did much to stand out from every other one. The theme is compelling, but it felt loosely coupled to the mechanics. Ultimately, I think this game will blur together in my memory with every other game in this category.Update: I've played this a lot recently and am bumping it up to an 8. I still agree with most of my assessment above, but I've still been really enjoying it. I think the unique clan powers make it particularly fun - they really vary the experience greatly.","user":{"username":"jerdude","id":"QfiJiogW5s"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YoVXov23k"}}},{"id":"KeGElMc7F8","date":"2020-03-24T18:53:14.217Z","rating":4,"title":"What a gre...","description":"What a great area control game.

Have played the game once (solo), which was quite alright. Would like to try this with more players. The box is quite a bit smaller then I had imagined and so are the components. Not a big problem, but some components are very small for my big fingers Have also played with 2 and 3 players and it is an interesting game which I would like to play some more. Unfortunately, the Cult of the New combined with a handful of campaign\/legacy games makes that there are always other games that have my attention.....","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YoVXov23k"}}},{"id":"Gxn6uQq7Nc","date":"2020-03-09T23:05:59.393Z","rating":4,"title":"Kickstarte...","description":"Kickstarter edition","user":{"username":"opticode","id":"GOBGDBMHVT"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YoVXov23k"}}},{"id":"w3g8NtxTU5","date":"2020-01-26T03:23:36.913Z","rating":3,"title":"Indeed, be...","description":"Indeed, better than Terra Mystica.

The variety of clans and their unique abilities ensures everyone's strategy is largely different. I pulled out a shocking win in my first game by virtue of Clan Buchanan's ability to get more contracts, making up for my game-long deficit in Glory Points with huge bonuses for goods shipped. Plenty of variability in setup means lots of replayability. This one deserves the hype it's getting. My only drawbacks: Some of the strategies and scoring are kind of difficult to grasp without more plays, so you won't really get to appreciate this game fully until you have it to the table several times.","user":{"username":"Squirrelhenge","id":"WzAPf81sGs"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YoVXov23k"}}},{"id":"33VyaFIH5z","date":"2019-11-12T00:21:57.043Z","rating":3,"title":"Amazon","description":"Amazon","user":{"username":"Bajahobo","id":"KKAnHdW75v"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"8YoVXov23k"}}},{"id":"YLuNVtpAJV","date":"2019-10-25T19:39:23.622Z","rating":3,"title":"FOR SALE\nF...","description":"FOR SALE\nFOR TRADE\n\nBrain burning engine builder with unique player abilities.
