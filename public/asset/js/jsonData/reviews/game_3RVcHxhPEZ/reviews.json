The mechanics force players to separate into groups and explore the house in order to grow his\/her character at the same time this makes the haunting more and more likely.  Highly recommend.","user":{"username":"Cheese","id":"oCyH5LQIjp"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"3RVcHxhPEZ"}}},{"id":"HtD5hiNJLx","date":"2020-03-07T03:11:42.002Z","rating":3,"title":"3-6","description":"3-6","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"3RVcHxhPEZ"}}},{"id":"9rNXY4AVZp","date":"2020-03-04T19:34:05.688Z","rating":1,"title":"very slow ...","description":"very slow turns, was falling asleep. awfuly bland artwork ie. monster counters that has the terifying word \"monster\" writen on it instead of a nice graphic.  even the name does not realy convey the horror theme well, though i did like the theme and the scenario book idea is good.","user":{"username":"antiussentiment","id":"jqE5Gn3RFW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"3RVcHxhPEZ"}}},{"id":"Wp14FpRdjI","date":"2020-02-26T18:04:18.752Z","rating":4,"title":"Ran throug...","description":"Ran through twice.

This along with Arkham\/Eldritch Horror are great gateway games to bridging the gap between tabletop roleplaying games & board games. If your players like this, there are plenty of horror or modern setting RPGs out there that your players might also like. \n\nAgain, make an expansion for this as with the tile based rooms & heavy story, it would be quite easy to make a new sequel or expansion. Also get rid of the clips for the characters (as a phone app takes care of it better), 75% of mine just slide over the character cards & they are just a bad design over putting a token over that marker instead (if it was a simple rectangle sheet instead of a pentagon).","user":{"username":"fox01313","id":"0fwkWT2y4p"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"3RVcHxhPEZ"}}},{"id":"uOWPhpWKmt","date":"2020-02-03T23:22:56.768Z","rating":3,"title":"Our family...","description":"Our family loves this game, it's a real must have for any serious collection.
