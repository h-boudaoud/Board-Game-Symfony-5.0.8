The enthusiasm of the creators is infectious but none of the four that I got did anything special. Playing them feels not quite like a chore but definitely obligatory in a lot of ways. No one that I've introduced the games to has been excited about any of it - bland art, bland theme, bland components, bland mechanics. Tiny Epic Bland.","user":{"username":"Blap The Smaker","id":"2nAlqZMPU7"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"0GVrFfaFUH"}}},{"id":"oGF0YzFC0s","date":"2020-02-06T19:41:31.953Z","rating":4,"title":"My first o...","description":"My first of the Tiny Epic series and I really enjoy the simple solo rules.","user":{"username":"Jcagno","id":"n8DC1U8AgV"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"0GVrFfaFUH"}}},{"id":"plLuCboxGQ","date":"2020-02-02T10:06:37.475Z","rating":3,"title":"Liked it a...","description":"Liked it at first but it is settling into a meh.

There is a great game here and it should just be \"normal\" size. \n\nEven though I don't like that the game is smaller it's still a fantastic game, however I highly recommend you getting the Beyond the Black expansion because it really pushes the game to the next level. I wouldn't play without it because it gives you more choices with bad die rolls and makes the game feel more thematic as you explore space trying to stay away from black holes.","user":{"username":"Deucejack","id":"mGrdNHgXEE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"0GVrFfaFUH"}}},{"id":"sYwQfF102P","date":"2020-01-25T05:59:59.876Z","rating":4,"title":"[b][size=1...","description":"[b][size=10][BGCOLOR=#add8e6]Need 115 CCG Sleeves[\/BGCOLOR][\/size][\/b]","user":{"username":"kentdavies","id":"LiAt0DjAeB"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"0GVrFfaFUH"}}},{"id":"SMX4ARxyI4","date":"2020-01-25T00:25:45.793Z","rating":1,"title":"First Impr...","description":"First Impression: It's just a mediocre dice game.","user":{"username":"warder57","id":"iaobIrOTQm"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"0GVrFfaFUH"}}},{"id":"J0YwbJeK0e","date":"2020-01-24T22:56:24.914Z","rating":4,"title":"1-5p","description":"1-5p","user":{"username":"saxsoulo","id":"fjfQxfGyjw"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"0GVrFfaFUH"}}},{"id":"WCdHNt7vYR","date":"2020-01-24T17:53:09.458Z","rating":3,"title":"The little...","description":"The little ships and such are fun.

I love how the game kicks into overdrive, and every decision gets weightier and weightier as you near the end. My only gripe is that the game always ends way too quickly. There's so many cool planets with cool abilities, but I don't get to use many of them, at least for very long, before the game ends. You don't realize how many points you easily and quickly rack up (remember upgrading your colony gives you points as well), and it can happen pretty fast. Overall, a pretty great game that grows on you, but don't expect to build this massive sprawling empire, the game ends faster than that.","user":{"username":"andrewmassengale","id":"ggC8Zs89ap"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"0GVrFfaFUH"}}},{"id":"a7eGj5Brg0","date":"2019-07-01T21:47:44.834Z","rating":3,"title":"It's ok.

I thought the other players aside from the main player will have things to do cause they can decide what they want with what the main player picks but the main player usually takes a long time deciding what to do with their dice. Led to a longer play time. Maybe it will be better with 2 players.
