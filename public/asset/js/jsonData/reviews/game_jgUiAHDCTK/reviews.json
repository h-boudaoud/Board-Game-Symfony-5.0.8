It definitely works well with 8 players, and the explanation takes longer than the actual game, if you're playing by the rules the way you're supposed to (I've heard horror stories). The real-time game is fun and frantic, and you can go at whatever pace you like, but it's up to you and your team to determine the best course of action. Requires being able to communicate well. Find some submarine sonar sound effects and turn on some colored lights in a dark room for added ambience.","user":{"username":"BackBurnerGames","id":"bLRwfwEKuF"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"MZbgVFt0sP","date":"2020-01-31T20:43:34.094Z","rating":4,"title":"The stress...","description":"The stress this game causes is crazy!

It's not the games fault but beware that's all.\n\nIf you do have a solid 8 players then you're in for a tense 4v4 battle. Nothing feels more satisfying than when you have this feeling that they are near your mine and then the captain says \"STOP! Detonating mine on B7.\" And then you hear the other captain look up and tell you \"Indirect hit.\" Now the chase is on to finish them off and it's extremely thrilling on either side.","user":{"username":"Deucejack","id":"mGrdNHgXEE"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"2TFVy4hcGL","date":"2020-01-24T21:59:27.092Z","rating":3,"title":"It's a pai...","description":"It's a pain in the ass to get 6-8 people together who want to play this.

It is a blast.  The first time you play there is a little apprehension about being able to keep it all together.  At some point you realize you don't have to, and no one else can anyway.  for the first few turns, the thought may come across your mind that you are never going to find the other sub, but then they have to surface, or they've created a pattern that significant narrows down the possibilities, and then it gets exciting.
