It boggles the mind on how the designer could achieve such intrisicate yet elegant game where 8 players desperately try to find and beat the other team.","user":{"username":"guzforster","id":"BXzlhlqwCb"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"eaDD6FM3dw","date":"2020-03-18T00:16:59.138Z","rating":3,"title":"Based on 2...","description":"Based on 2 plays with 6 players.

Would not buy it (won't hit the table at home), but I'll play along.","user":{"username":"DeKerstman","id":"A9dhwypSMo"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"pptEvgPtFL","date":"2020-03-07T03:11:45.435Z","rating":3,"title":"2-8","description":"2-8","user":{"username":"Enduro","id":"XXjHIAff8d"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"tSyqWaoLhc","date":"2020-03-04T19:34:37.777Z","rating":3,"title":"I've never...","description":"I've never got such an adrenaline rush from playing a game.

Amazingly creative game design..","user":{"username":"antiussentiment","id":"jqE5Gn3RFW"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"KpAWfiwBaG","date":"2020-02-05T16:03:08.131Z","rating":4,"title":"The high p...","description":"The high player count might deter some people from playing it. It definitely works well with 8 players, and the explanation takes longer than the actual game, if you're playing by the rules the way you're supposed to (I've heard horror stories). The real-time game is fun and frantic, and you can go at whatever pace you like, but it's up to you and your team to determine the best course of action. Requires being able to communicate well. Find some submarine sonar sound effects and turn on some colored lights in a dark room for added ambience.","user":{"username":"BackBurnerGames","id":"bLRwfwEKuF"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"MZbgVFt0sP","date":"2020-01-31T20:43:34.094Z","rating":4,"title":"The stress...","description":"The stress this game causes is crazy! I love the tactical feel to this game and that you do feel like you're in a Submarine trying to attack another sub.  I love how every job is different and important and that working as a team and discussing tactics is crucial!!

I much prefer Space Cadets: Dice Duel, though, if for no other reason than it is vastly more flexible in terms of player count.","user":{"username":"Gyges","id":"33SQHhOEDt"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}},{"id":"UXYpde6BVE","date":"2020-01-26T00:09:25.784Z","rating":4,"title":"Best with ...","description":"Best with 8","user":{"username":"TalksToChalk","id":"ttBznVfupr"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"jgUiAHDCTK"}}}]
