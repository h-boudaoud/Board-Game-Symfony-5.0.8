So easy to play and really funny. The art on the coasters is beautiful, but could just as well be played in a bar with standard coasters or playing cards.Great bluffing game, very easy to teach.","user":{"username":"andybeta","id":"iBINPaJZ01"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"K92cryrFW5"}}},{"id":"KAahRg2mui","date":"2020-04-01T02:53:21.148Z","rating":3,"title":"This boils...","description":"This boils down the bluffing liar's dice and those type games down to what it really should be.  I think it might do better than Liar's Dice in all but one area.  I think Skull is great with 4-6, maybe even 7 or 8 would be okay.  But 9-12.  I think it just gets too long and too hard to keep track of what's going on.","user":{"username":"SybotCB","id":"zHzcYgmRew"},"game":{"id":{"objectId":"K92cryrFW5"}}},{"id":"VrGIEsqHfy","date":"2020-03-05T16:07:28.588Z","rating":3,"title":"Used UNO p...","description":"Used UNO pack to simulate the experience.

Maybe the game is more fun if you're drunk and in a bar? But then you'd have to be in a bar.
