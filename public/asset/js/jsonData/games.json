OK, without all but 16 cards of it, at least.\u00a0 Munchkin Loot Letter \u00a0is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2-4 players.    Love Letter: Legend of the Five Rings:    Love and Honor. A vision of loveliness and poise, Iweko Miaka\u2019s position of princess in the Imperial family ensures her betrothal will be a great contest for the samurai clans of the Emerald Empire. Whichever clan can win her as a wife for one of their young samurai will secure standing and glory for decades to come. And though the marriage may be political, what better way to influence the decision than by winning the heart of the princess herself?   Letters to Santa:   If you want all of your Christmas wishes brought by the big guy, you\u2019ll need to make sure your letter makes it to him. The closer you get the letter to Santa, the more likely you are to win! But watch out for the wily Krampus, out to dash your yuletide dreams!   Letters to Santa  is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2\u20134 players. Your goal is to get your letter into Santa's hands while deflecting the letters from others. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!

Meanwhile, each of your adventures in Arkham horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the ancient ones straining against the barriers to our world\u2026 the basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand. And your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you\".","image_url":"https:\/\/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/5cc.images\/games\/uploaded\/1559257204681-515mUPxEHZL.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/5cc.images\/games\/uploaded\/1559257204681-515mUPxEHZL.jpg","images":{"thumb":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/40x40\/games\/uploaded\/1559257204681-515mUPxEHZL.jpg","small":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/150x150\/games\/uploaded\/1559257204681-515mUPxEHZL.jpg","medium":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/350x350\/games\/uploaded\/1559257204681-515mUPxEHZL.jpg","large":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/700x700\/games\/uploaded\/1559257204681-515mUPxEHZL.jpg","original":"https:\/\/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/5cc.images\/games\/uploaded\/1559257204681-515mUPxEHZL.jpg"},"url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/search\/game\/4G32qGJZWs\/arkham-horror-the-card-game","price":"0.00","msrp":"0.00","discount":"0.00","primary_publisher":"Fantasy Flight Publishing","publishers":["Fantasy Flight Games"],"mechanics":[{"id":"vZsDDAdOoe","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/mechanic\/vZsDDAdOoe\/undefined"},{"id":"WPytek5P8l","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/mechanic\/WPytek5P8l\/undefined"},{"id":"9mNukNBxfZ","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/mechanic\/9mNukNBxfZ\/undefined"}],"categories":[{"id":"KUBCKBkGxV","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/category\/KUBCKBkGxV\/undefined"},{"id":"eX8uuNlQkQ","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/category\/eX8uuNlQkQ\/undefined"},{"id":"ZTneo8TaIO","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/category\/ZTneo8TaIO\/undefined"},{"id":"cAIkk5aLdQ","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/category\/cAIkk5aLdQ\/undefined"}],"designers":["Nate French","Matthew Newman"],"developers":[],"artists":[" Christopher Hosch","Marcin Jakubowski","Ignacio Baz\u00e1n Lazcano","Henning Ludvigsen","Mercedes Opheim","Zoe Robinson","Evan Simonet"],"names":["Arkham Horror LCG","Arkham Horror: Das Kartenspiel "],"num_user_ratings":193,"average_user_rating":3.8382006594441824,"official_url":"https:\/\/www.fantasyflightgames.com\/en\/products\/arkham-horror-the-card-game\/?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=bga_ads","rules_url":"https:\/\/images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com\/filer_public\/88\/53\/88538d11-5274-4b4a-ac8c-e8d758f71132\/ahc01_learn_to_play_web.pdf","weight_amount":2,"weight_units":"lbs","size_height":10,"size_width":2,"size_depth":10,"size_units":"inches ","matches_specs":null,"spec":[{"id":"L7kGfX7JlX"},{"id":"j4bHFijdvS"}],"reddit_all_time_count":531,"reddit_week_count":8,"reddit_day_count":16,"historical_low_price":0,"historical_low_date":"2019-03-18T12:51:44.989Z","rank":35,"trending_rank":83},{"id":"6VQXkkC5ql","name":"Dominion: Second Edition","year_published":2016,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"min_playtime":15,"max_playtime":60,"min_age":14,"description":"You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens.

The 14 fantasy races come with matching banners and tokens, and the game also includes 20 special power badges to further customize the races along with mountains, troll lairs, fortresses, holes-in-the-ground, victory coins. and other items.","image_url":"https:\/\/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/5cc.images\/games\/uploaded\/1559254992240-511JJsfrrNL.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/5cc.images\/games\/uploaded\/1559254992240-511JJsfrrNL.jpg","images":{"thumb":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/40x40\/games\/uploaded\/1559254992240-511JJsfrrNL.jpg","small":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/150x150\/games\/uploaded\/1559254992240-511JJsfrrNL.jpg","medium":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/350x350\/games\/uploaded\/1559254992240-511JJsfrrNL.jpg","large":"https:\/\/d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net\/700x700\/games\/uploaded\/1559254992240-511JJsfrrNL.jpg","original":"https:\/\/s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/5cc.images\/games\/uploaded\/1559254992240-511JJsfrrNL.jpg"},"url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/search\/game\/8UmzC1ZGGE\/small-world","price":"37.99","msrp":"50.00","discount":"0.20","primary_publisher":"Days of Wonder","publishers":["Days of Wonder"],"mechanics":[{"id":"05zCZoLvQJ","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/mechanic\/05zCZoLvQJ\/undefined"},{"id":"R0bGq4cAl4","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/mechanic\/R0bGq4cAl4\/undefined"}],"categories":[{"id":"ZTneo8TaIO","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/category\/ZTneo8TaIO\/undefined"},{"id":"upXZ8vNfNO","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/category\/upXZ8vNfNO\/undefined"},{"id":"buDTYyPw4D","url":"https:\/\/www.boardgameatlas.com\/category\/buDTYyPw4D\/undefined"}],"designers":[" Philippe Keyaerts"],"developers":[],"artists":["Miguel Coimbra","Cyrille Daujean"],"names":["Small World","\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440","\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01","\u30b9\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9","\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c"],"num_user_ratings":330,"average_user_rating":3.2341032981524958,"official_url":"https:\/\/www.daysofwonder.com\/smallworld\/en\/?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=bga_ads","rules_url":"https:\/\/www.daysofwonder.com\/smallworld\/en\/content\/rules\/","weight_amount":4.23,"weight_units":"lbs","size_height":11.6,"size_width":11.6,"size_depth":3,"size_units":"inches ","matches_specs":null,"spec":[],"reddit_all_time_count":339,"reddit_week_count":0,"reddit_day_count":3,"historical_low_price":0,"historical_low_date":"2020-01-15T18:01:12.494Z","rank":40,"trending_rank":198},{"id":"1sQP1kNHja","name":"Roll For The Galaxy","year_published":2014,"min_players":2,"max_players":5,"min_playtime":45,"max_playtime":60,"min_age":13,"description":"Roll for the Galaxy is a dice game of building space empires for 2-5 players.
